1. “直接引语”变为“间接引语”时时态的变化

   - 总结：当主句为一般过去时的时候，间接引语一定要后退一个时态

   - 当主句为一般过去时，并且直接引语为一般现在时，那么间接引语就要变为一般过去时

   ```
   5分钟前：
   杰克：“我好累”
   // 现在为一般现在时

   现在：
   汤姆：“杰克说他好累”
   // “杰克说他好累”。“杰克说”已经是5分钟前说的了。“累”是5分钟前的事了
   ```

   ```
   Five minutes ago:
   Jack: "I feel tired"
   // `I feel tired`为直接引语

   Now
   Tom: "Jack said he felt tired"
   // 因为杰克说的话和感到累都是5分钟前发生的事了
   // `Jack said`为主句。`he felt tired`为间接引语


   Five minutes ago:
   The book is interesting

   Now
   What did he say?

   He said that the book was interesting
   ```

   - 当主句为一般过去时，并且直接引语为现在进行时，那么间接引语就要变为过去进行时

   ```
   5分钟前：
   杰克：“我在等公交车”

   现在：
   汤姆：“杰克说他当时在等公交车”
   ```

   ```

   Now:
   What did they tell you?

   They told me they were having dinner
   ```

   - 当主句为一般过去时，并且直接引语为现在完成时/一般过去时，那么间接引语就要变为过去完成时

   ```

   // 现在完成时

   Now:

   He said he had finished his homework

## Sensational news!

Have you just made a new film, Miss Marsh?

Yes, I have

Are you going to make another?

No, I'm not. I'm going to retire. I feel very tired. I don't want to make another film for a long time

Let's buy a newspaper, Liz. Listen to this!

'Karen Marsh: Sensational News! By out reporter, Alan Jones'

'Karen Marsh arrived at London Airport today. She was wearing a blue dress and a mink coat'

'She told me she had just made a new film. She said she was not going to make another. She said she was going to retire'

'She told reporters she felt very tired and didn't want to make another film for a long time'

I wonder why!
