# Lesson 51

1. `sweet` 与 `pleasant` 也可以用来形容人

   ```
   She is sweet, she is pleasant, she is upbeat
   她很可爱，很讨人喜欢，也很乐观
   ```

2. 针对 `sometimes`，`always`，`every day`等频率副词，需要用`How often`去提问

   ```
   The weather rains in spring sometimes

   Does the weather rain in spring sometimes?

   How often does the weather rain in spring?
   春天的天气多久下一次雨？

   I drink milk every day

   Do you drink milk every day?

   How often do you drink milk?
   ```

3. 如果存在`be`动词，那么`often` 和 `always` 要放在`be`动词后面。 `be + often/always`

   ```
   She is often cute

   You are always tired

   I am always happy
   ```
