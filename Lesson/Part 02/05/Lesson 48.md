# Lesson 48

## Words

- pull cotton wool collect collection nod meanwhile

## Did you want to tell something?

```
Dentists always ask questions when it is impossible for you to answer.

My dentist had just pulled out one of my teeth and had told me to rest for a while. I tried to say something, but my mouth was full of cotton wool.

He knew I collected match boxes and asked me whether my collection was growing. He then asked how my brother was and whether I liked my new job in London.

In answer to these questions I either nodded or made strange noises. Meanwhile, my tongue was busy searching out the hole where the tooth had been.

I suddenly felt very worried, but could not say anything. When the dentist at last removed the cotton wool from my mouth, I was able to tell him that he had pulled out the wrong tooth.
