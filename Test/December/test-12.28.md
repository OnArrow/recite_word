I live in a very old town which is surrounded by beautiful woods
我住在一个被美丽的树林包围着的非常古老的镇子里

It is a famous beauty spot
它是一个著名的风景点

On Sundays, hundreds of people come from the city to see our town and to walk through the woods
在周六，来自城市中的数以百计的人来看我们的镇子，还在森林中散步

Visitor have been asked to keep the woods clean and tidy
游客被要求保持森林干净和整洁

Litter baskets have been placed under the trees
垃圾筐被放在树下

But people still throw their rubbish everywhere
但人们仍然把他们的垃圾扔得到处都是

Last Wednesday, I went for a walk in the woods
上周三，我去森林中散步

What I saw made me very sad
我所见到的一切使我非常难过

I counted seven old cars and three old refrigerators
我数出了七辆旧的车和三个旧的冰箱

The litter baskets were empty and the ground was covered with pieces of paper, cigarette ends, old tyres, empty bottles and rusty tins
垃圾桶都是空的，地面满是纸张碎片，烟头，旧轮胎，空瓶子和生锈的罐头

Among the rubbish, I found a sign which said, 'Anyone who leaves litter in these woods will be prosecuted!'
在这些垃圾中间，我找到一个写着“任何在这些森林里丢下垃圾的人都将被起诉！”的牌子
