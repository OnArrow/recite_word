   - `have to`更多地表示客观情况，如他人的命令或章程

   - `must` 更多地表示主观意愿，就是自己的想法

   ```
   这个聚会很有趣，但现在已经晚上十一点了，而且你妈妈已经打电话过来催促你回家了，你不得不回家
   // 主观上不想回家，但客观上不得不回

   这个聚会很无聊，你玩一会儿就不想继续待下去了，这时候你找借口说：“我妈打电话来了，我不得不回家了”
   // 回家是自己的主观意愿
   ```

   ```
   This is a interesting party, but I have to go home because it's late
