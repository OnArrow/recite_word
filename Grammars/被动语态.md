# 被动语态

1. 汉语里的 `主动` 和 `被动`

   - 主动

   ```
   我扇了他一巴掌

   我喝了一瓶水

   他写完了作业
   ```

   - 被动

   ```
   我 被 打了

   我 应邀 出席

   我 受到 老师的表扬

   我 遭到 父母的批评
   ```

   - 加上时态的 `被动`

   ```
   我昨天被打了

   我经常被打

   我刚挨揍

   明天我要挨打了
   ```

2. Features:

   - 被动语态结构：`be（表示时态） + done（表示被动）`

## 与时态结合

### 被动语态 & Simple Present

- 根据被动语态结构，`be` 的一般现在时为 `am/is/are`，而 `done` 表示的是动词的过去分词

- 因此，一般现在时的被动语态结构为：`am/is/are + done`

```
Jack cleans the room everyday
杰克每天都打扫房间
// 这是主动语态。杰克是动作的发起者，房间是动作的承受者

The room is cleaned everyday
房间每天都被打扫
// 被动语态。房间被谁打扫不重要，重要的是房间是动作的承受者
// 根据结构，主语为`the room`，那么应该用`is`，`clean`应该变为过去分词`cleaned`

The room is cleaned by Jack everyday
房间每天都被杰克打扫
// 给被动语态的句子添加更多信息

Is the room cleaned everyday?
房间每天都被打扫吗？
// 一般疑问句

Why is the room cleaned everyday?

// 特殊疑问句

## 与情态动词结合

1. 被动语态通常是 `be done`，而情态动词后面跟的通常是 `be` 的原型

2. 结构：

   ```
   can/could be done

   will/would be done

   must be done

   have to be done
   ```

3. Examples

   ```
   The voice can be heard

   The car will be repaired

   The room must be cleaned

   The door has to be closed
   ```

4. 情态动词表示推测时

   ```
   你一定是被车撞了

   你一定不是被车撞了

   你可能是被车撞了

   你可能不是被车撞了
   ```

5. 表示推测的结构：

   ```
   must have been done

   can't have been done

   may/might have been done

   may/might not have been done
   ```

6. Examples

   ```
   The voice must have been heard

   The door can't have been opened

   The wallet may have been stolen

   The bill may not have been paid
   ```
