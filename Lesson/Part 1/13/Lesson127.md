# Lesson 127

1. `must`

   - `must`有两个含义：一个表示“必须”，另一个表示“推测”。这里`must`表示“推测”的意思

   - 表示推测，而且这个推测确信度高，对现在的发生的事的肯定推测：一定是

   - `must be`中的`be`为原型，不和时态所关联

   - `must be`后面可以跟各种时态

   - `must be` 替换的是句子中的 `be`。相当于把一句肯定句换成了推测句

   ```
   在大街上你看到一个人特别像周杰伦，你上去打招呼说“你一定是周杰伦吧？”。这时对你来说这个推测的确信度很高，那个人很有可能是周杰伦

   这个水壶里有水
   // 肯定句

   这个水壶里一定有水
   // 推测句
   ```

   ```
   You must be Jack
   你一定是杰克吧
   // 很大可能是杰克，但还存在一点小小的不确定性

   You must be having tea
   你一定在喝茶吧
   // 现在进行时

   That restaurant must be very good, it's always full of people

   Someone must be knocking at the door

   He must be mistaken, you must be at least 60. But you cannot be 80!
   // 现在完成时
   // `cannot` = `can't`

   Must he be Jack?
   // 一般疑问句，`must`提句首

   Why must he be Jack?


   There is some water in the kettle

   There must be some water in the kettle
   // 用`must be`替换掉了上一句中的`be`动词
   ```

   - `be` 不是一定需要的，需要看`must`后面跟的是什么时态。简单来说就是`be`有没有取决于肯定句中的`be`动词有没有

   ```
   He is clever
   // 肯定句

   He must be clever
   // 因为上一句是一般现在时，所以需要`is`，当转换成推测句时，就需要`be`


   The book cost two pounds
   // 肯定句

   The book must cost two pounds
   // 上一句也是一般现在时，`cost`前面不需要`is`，当转换成推测句时，也不需要


   He is sweeping the floor

   He must be sweeping the floor
   ```

2. `can't be`

   - 与`must be`刚好相反，但表达的是“一定不是”

   ```
   You can't be Jack
   你一定不是杰克

   You can't be having tea
   你一定没有在喝茶

   That restaurant can't be very good, it's always empty

   Can't he be Jack?

   Why can't he be Jack?
   ```

3. `at least` 至少。`more than` 超过

   ```
   You must be at least twenty
   你一定至少20岁了

   She can't be more than twenty
   她一定没有超过20岁
   ```

4. `think so` 同意某人的观点

   ```
   The man who is drinking must be Jack

   I think so

   Jack can't be the tallest in the class

   I don't think so
   ```

5. `hope so` 希望如此 `hope not` 不希望如此

   ```
   Will she invite you to her next party?

   I hope so

   Does she know everything about you?

   I hope not
   ```

## Words

```
famous actress actor read
```

## A famous actress

```
Can you recognize that woman, Liz?

I think I can, Kate. It must be Karen Marsh, the actress

I thought so

Who's that beside her?

That must be Conrad Reeves

Conrad Reeves, the actor? It can't be. Let me have another look. I think you're right

Isn't he her third husband?

No, He must be her fourth or fifth

Doesn't Karen Marsh look old!

She does, doesn't she! I read she's twenty-nine, but she must be at least forty

I'm sure she is

She was a famous actress when I was still at school

That was a long time ago, wasn't it?

Not that long ago! I'm not more than twenty-nine myself
```
