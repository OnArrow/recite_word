# Lesson 40

## Marks

1. M: 虚拟语气

## Words

- hostess unsmiling tight fix globe despair

## Food and talk

```
Last week at a dinner party, the hostess asked me to sit next to Mrs. Rumbold.

Mrs. Rumbold was a large, unsmiling lady in a tight black dress. She did not even look up when I took my seat beside her. Her eyes were fixed on her plate and in a short time, she was busy eating.

I tried to make conversation. 'A new play is coming to "The Globe" soon,' I said. 'Will you be seeing it?'

'No,' she answered.

'Will you be spending your holidays abroad this year?' I asked.

'No,' she answered.

'Will you be staying in England?' I asked.

'No,' she answered.

In despair, I asked her whether she was enjoying her dinner.

'Young man,' she answered, 'if you ate more and talked less, we would both enjoy our dinner!'
```

## Questions

1. `she was busy eating` 中的 `busy` 什么词性

## Whole

1. `ess` 通常都表示女性

   ```
   host
   hostess

   actor
   actress
   ```

2. `in despair` 绝望当中

   ```
   In despair, I suddenly heard a voice from the hole
   ```

3. `be busy doing sth.` 忙着做某事。 `doing` 为 `动名词`

   ```
   She's busy having an operation

   I was busy finishing my homework

   They were busy wrapping it up
   ```

4. `将来进行时` 比 `一般将来时` 说话表达的意思更委婉一点。

   ```
   Will you have dinner with me tonight?
   // 很直接，你今晚要不要和我吃饭？

   Will you be having dinner with me tonight?
   // 更委婉一点。你愿意今晚和我一起吃饭吗？
   // 别人听起来会更有礼貌一点
   ```

5. `to` 后面跟的往往是 `v.`，`for` 后面跟的往往是 `n.`

6. `虚拟语气`

   - 汉语中的虚拟语气

     - 汉语中表示虚拟语气的情况复杂得多，你要对说话的背景有所了解，对说话人有所了解，从说话人的语气、语调、面目表情等来揣摩或者推测他说的是不是真的，还是说只是在开玩笑。总的来说，全凭语感

     ```
     我是一个骑行爱好者，但是其它舍友并不知道我有骑行这个爱好。到快放国庆假期了，需要抢票回家，我规划了一下，发现骑行300公里回家是可能的。然后我就对舍友说，如果待会我抢不到回家的高铁票，那我就骑车回家。这时舍友哈哈大笑，因为他们觉得我平时不怎么运动，根本不可能可以骑行300公里回家，觉得这个概率非常非常低。对于他们来说，我这句话就是虚拟语气，因为他们对我不了解。但对我来说这句话不是虚拟语气，我是认真的。

     S赛决赛上，IG已经 2:0 T1，并且现在也已经领先2万经济，我就说 “如果T1还能夺冠，我直接从韩国游回去”。实际上我说的这句话就是虚拟语气，我觉得T1能夺冠的概率非常非常低

     "如果我当了美国总统，我就会做...。" 这句话就是虚拟语气，因为我不可能当上美国总统的
     ```

   - 含义:

     1. `if` 从句中的 `v.` 与 `现在` 事实相反

     2. 说话人认为，`if` 从句中 `v.` 发生的几率非常低，几乎不可能

   - 结构: `if + did/were, 主语 + would/should/could/might + do`

     - 结构中的 `did` 并不表示 `过去`。和 `一般过去时` 没有关系

     - 不管是什么人称，后面跟的都是 `were`，没有 `was`

     - 英文中只要看到 `if + did/were` 结构，那么基本可以断定这是 `虚拟语气`。不用像中文一样想太多

     - 两个句子的顺序和 `if条件状语从句` 一样，是可以反着来的

     ```
     If I knew him better, I might invite him to dinner
     // `knew` 为 `did`
     // `I` 为主语，`might`，`invite` 为 `do`

     If I were you, I would not do that
     // 这里不用 `was`，而是用 `were`

     It's cold. If I were you, I would put my coat on

     If she were here, I would get the dinner ready

     If he couldn't get an air ticket, he'd go by boat
     // 怎么可能，他一定能买到票的

     If I didn't hear from him, I'd write another letter

     I'd help her if she told me the reason
     ```

   - `if条件状语从句` & `虚拟语气`

   ```
   If I see him, I will apologize him
   // 字面意思，我以后只要见到他，就向他道歉
   // 这件事是有可能发生的

   If I saw him, I would apologize him
   // 有一个潜台词的表达: 我认为我以后不会再见到他了
   ```
