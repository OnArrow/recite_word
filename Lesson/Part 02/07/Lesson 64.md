## The Channel Tunnel!

```
In 1858, a French engineer, Aime Thome de Gamond, arrived in England with a plan for a twenty-one-mile tunnel under the English Channel.

He said that it would be possible to build a platform in the centre of the Channel. This platform would serve as a port and a railway station.

The tunnel would be well-ventilated if tall chimneys were built above sea level.

In 1860, a better plan was put forward by an Englishman, William Low. He suggested that a double railway-tunnel should be built.

This would solve the problem of ventilation, for if a train entered this tunnel, it would draw in fresh air behind it.

Forty-two years later a tunnel was actually begun. If, at the time, the British had not feared invasion, it would have been completed. The world had to wait almost another 100 years for the Channel Tunnel.

It was officially opened on March 7, 1994, finally connecting Britain to the European continent.

    He suggests that she get a job in a bank.
    // `should` 可以被省略，虽然省略了 `should`，但后面还是用原形 `get` 而不是 `gets`，因为 `should` 后面跟的是原形
    // 这句话是对的

    He suggested that she get a job in a bank.
    // `should` 被省略了，但因为 `should` 后跟的是原形，所以用 `get` 而不是 `got`
    // 这句话是对的

    He suggests that she gets a job in a bank.
    // 虽然用法是上面的用法，但实际应用中，也可以正常使用 `gets`
    // 这句话是对的

12. M: `与过去事实相反的虚拟语气`

    - 汉语中的虚拟语气

      ```
      如果我昨晚不那么累，我就会陪你出去走走。
      // 实际上昨晚我并没有出去走走，因为我很累
      // 说的是过去的事情

      当时如果在街上见到你，我会给你打招呼的。
      // 实际上我当时没见到你，所以也就没和你打招呼
      // 说的是过去的事情

      我们第一次相遇时如果你没有说出那句话，那我们就不会相识了。
      // 你当时说出了那句话，我们相识了
      // 说的是过去的事情
      ```

    - 含义

      1. 说的是过去发生的事情

      2. 实际发生的和说出来的话是相反的

    - 结构: `if 主语 had done..., 主语 would/could/might/should have done`

      ```
      If I had gone to the party last night, I would have met lots of people.
      如果我昨晚去参加派对，我会认识很多人
      // 实际上昨晚我并没有去，也就没有认识很对人。实际发生的和说出来的话是相反的

      I hadn't gone to the party. I haven't met lots of people.
      // 上一句基本就等同于这两句


      She would have sent a telegram if she hadn't received his letter.
      // 信收到了，就没有再使用电报去发信给他了


      I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't come back.
      // 你回来了
      ```

    - 变体: `if you could have done` = `if you had been able to do`

      ```
      If you had been able to speak to me the first time in the jungle, what would you have said?

      If you could have spoken to me the first time in the jungle, what would you have said?
      // 等价于上一句


      You know, I would have been a painter if I had been able to do anything.

      You know, I would have been a painter if I could have done anything.
      // 等价于上一句
      ```

    - `与现在事实相反的虚拟语气` & `与过去事实相反的虚拟语气`

      ```
      If I were hungry, I would eat something.
      如果我饿，我会吃点东西
      // 说的是现在。如果现在我饿
      // 现在没有饿，也就没有吃东西

      If I had been hungry, I would have eaten something.
      如果我饿，我会吃点东西
      // 说的是过去。如果当时我饿
      // 当时没有饿，也就没有吃东西
      ```
