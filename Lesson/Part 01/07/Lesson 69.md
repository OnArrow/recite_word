## The car race

```
There is a car race near our town every year

In 1995, there was a very big race

There were hundreds of people there. My wife and I were at the race. Our friends Julie and Jack were there, too

You can see us in the crowd. We are standing on the left

There were twenty cars in the race. There were English cars, French cars, German cars, Italian cars, American cars and Japanese cars

It was an exciting finish. The winner was Billy Stewart. He was in car number fifteen. Five other cars were just behind him

On the way home, my wife said to me, 'Don't drive so quickly! You're not Billy Stewart!'
