# Lesson 19

1. `What's the matter?` 和 `What's wrong?` 意思相等，都表示“怎么了？”

   ```
   What's the matter? parents?

   We're cold and hungry

   What's wrong? children?

   We're tired and thirsty
   ```

2. `sit down`中的`sit`后面的`t`可以省略不读，这种叫做“失去爆破音”（音标`[t]`为爆破音，`[d]`也是）

3. `right`

   ```
   I'm all right
   我没事

   Are you all right?
   你还好吗？
   ```

4. `here`

   ```
   I'm here
   我在这里

   Here you are
   给你

   Here it is
   就是它

   Come here
   到这来

   Here is my ticket
   这是我的票

   Here are our passports
   这是我们的护照
   ```

5. `Who`

   ```
   The boy is thirsty and tired

   Is the boy thirsty and tired?

   Who is thirsty and tired?
   谁又渴又累？
   ```

6. `Whose`

   ```
   These ice creams are mine

   Are these ice creams yours?

   Whose are these ice creams?

   Whose ice creams are these?
   ```

7. `Come`

   ```
   Come in
   进来

   Come on
   快点；来吧

   Come upstairs
   到楼上

   Come and meet our employees
   来见见我们的雇员
   ```

8. `Those`读作“豆子”
