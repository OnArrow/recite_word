# Lesson 17

## Words

- appear stage bright sock stocking spite

## Always young

```
My aunt Jennifer is an actress. She must be at least thirty-five years old. In spite of this, she often appears on the stage as a young girl.

Jennifer will have to take part in a new play soon. This time, she will be a girl of seventeen. In the play, she must appear in a bright red dress and long black stockings.

Last year in another play, she had to wear short socks and a bright, orange-coloured dress.

If anyone ever asks her how old she is, she always answers, 'Darling, it must be terrible to be grown up!'
```

## Whole

1. `grown up` 成年人。通常是大人和小孩之间才这样称呼

   ```
   'I'm scared, Dad.'

   'Yes, I know, and sometimes grown ups get scared and worried too, you know.'


   I don't want to sit with the grown ups. I want to go and play with the other kids.


   'Tom, don't try to grow up too fast.'

   'But I'm grown up.'
   ```

2. `have to`、`had better` 和 `must`、`can`、`will` 一样，都属于情态动词，所以不要将 `have to` 分开成 `have + to`，而应该把它们看成一个词。因此 `not` 都是加在后面的

   ```
   You have to leave.

   You have not to leave
   // Error

   You have to not leave.
   // Right


   You had better leave.

   You had not better leave
   // Error

   You had better not leave.
   // Right
   ```

3. `must` 引导的疑问句通常会变成用 `have to` 提问而不是 `must`。虽然说用 `must` 也行，但现实生活中通常用 `have to`

   ```
   I must leave.

   Must you leave?

   Do you have to leave?
   // 更多会用这句

   Why must you leave?

   Why do you have to leave?
   // 更多会用这句
   ```

4. `have to` 可以配合时态使用

   ```
   He had to leave.

   He didn't have to leave.

   He has to leave for his son every day.

   He doesn't have to leave for his son every day.

   He will have to leave in a few minutes.

   He is going to have to leave tomorrow.
   ```

5. 尽管 `have to` 和 `must` 会区分客观情况和主观感受，但在美式英语中，不太注重区分这个，大多数情况下直接用 `have to` 即可

6. 在口语上，`have to` 有时会被人读作 `have got to`，二者是等价的。但仅限于口语用，并且是肯定句

   ```
   I have to leave.

   以下三句都是口语表达，都表示`我不得不离开`

   I have got to leave.

   I've gotta leave.
   // 和`wanna`一样，`got to`可以简写成`gotta`

   I gotta leave.
   ```

7. `I doubt it` 我怀疑这件事；我觉得这事不太可能

   ```
   Do you think Tom will get a very good salary?

   I doubt it. This firm doesn't offer such a high salary.
   ```

8. `pick up` 接人

   ```
   Who will you pick up at the airport?
   ```

9. `in spite of ...` 尽管什么什么

   ```
   In spite of this.
   尽管这样

   In spite of that.
   尽管那样

   The sun is shine, in spite of this, they went on a journey.

   In spite of rain, we looked for my dog on the street for 4 hours.
   ```

10. `at least` 至少

    ```
    At least, I believe he can't have borrowed any money from you.
    ```

11. `it must be terrible to do sth.` 做某件事一定是糟糕的

    ```
    It must be terrible to take a lift from a stranger.

    It must be terrible to keep order on these occasions.

    It must be terrible not to finish the work.
    ```
