# Lesson 129

1. `must` 表示推测

   - 基本公式：

     - `must have been adj./n.`

     - `must have done`

     - `must have been doing`

     - 以上的`have been`跟现在完成时没有关系，只是`must`的固定搭配

   - 表示推测，而且这个推测确信度高，对过去的肯定推测：当时一定是

   ```
   I must have been crazy
   我当时一定是疯了
   // `must have been adj./n.`

   He must have been tired
   他当时一定很累

   She must have eaten the apple
   她一定是吃苹果
   // `must have done`

   He must have seen the speed limit
   他当时一定看到限速牌了

   They must have been having a party
   他们当时一定是在举办一个派对
   // `must have been doing`

   Must they have been having a party?
   // 一般疑问句

   What must they have doing?
   // 特殊疑问句
   ```

   - `must` 后面跟的是`have done`还是`have been`要看肯定句来判断

   ```
   He was sleeping
   // 肯定句

   He must have been sleeping
   // 肯定句中有`be`动词`was`，所以这里也要有`be`动词`been`


   There were many people there
   // 肯定句

   There must have been many people there


   The shop was full of people
   // 肯定句

   The shop must have been full of people


   He saw me yesterday
   // 肯定句

   He must have seen me yesterday


   He did it
   // 肯定句

   He must have done it


   He passed all the exams
   // 肯定句

   He must have passed all the exams
   // 注意这里`passed`为过去分词


   He went to China yesterday
   // 肯定句

   He must have gone to China yesterday
   ```

2. `can't` 表示推测

   - 与`must`刚好相反，但表达的是“当时一定不是”

   ```
   I can't have been crazy
   我当时一定没疯

   He can't have been tired
   他当时一定不累

   She can't have eaten the apple
   她一定没吃苹果

   He can't have seen the speed limit
   他当时一定没看到限速牌

   They can't have been having a party
   他们当时一定没有在开派对
   ```

3. `wave to sb.` 朝某人招手

   ```
   She is waving to me
   ```

4. `away` 表示“距离...有多远”

   ```
   The railway station is 4 miles away
   火车站在4英里远的地方
   ```

## Seventy miles an hour

```
Look, Gary! That policeman's waving to you. He wants you to stop

Where do you think you are? On a race track? You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour

I can't have been

I was doing eighty when I overtook you

Didn't you see the speed limit?

I'm afraid I didn't, officer. I must have been dreaming

He wasn't dreaming, officer. I was telling him to drive slowly

That's why I didn't see the sign

Let me see your driving license

I won't charge you this time. But you'd better not do it again!

Thank you. I'll certainly be more careful

I told you to drive slowly, Gary

You always tell me to drive slowly, darling

Well, next time you'd better take my advice!
```
