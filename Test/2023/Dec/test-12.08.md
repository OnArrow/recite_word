After I had eaten the apple, I had a stomachache

Do you like stories?

I want to tell you a true story

It happened to a friend of mind a year ago

While my friend, George, was reading in bed, two thieves climbed into his kitchen

After they had entered the house, they went into the dining room

It was very dark, so they turned on the torch

Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them

'What's up! What's up' someone called

The thieves dropped the torch and ran away as quickly as they could

George heard a noise and came downstairs quickly

He turned on the light, but he couldn't see anyone

The thieves had already gone

But George's parrot, Henry, was still there

'What's up, George?' he called

'Nothing, Henry' George said and smiled

'Go back to sleep'
