# Lesson 20

## Words

- catch fisherman boot waste realize

## One man in a boat

```
Fishing is my favorite sport. I often fish for hours without catching anything. But this does not worry me.

Some fishermen are unlucky. Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and rubbish. I am even less lucky. I never catch anything - not even old boots.

After having spent whole mornings on the river, I always go home with an empty bag. 'You must give up fishing!' my friend say. 'It's a waste of time.'

But they don't realize one important thing. I'm not really interested in fishing. I am only interested in sitting in a boat and doing nothing at all!
```

## Whole

1. `catch your eye` 吸引你的注意

2. `watch your tongue` 不要口无遮拦

3. `nonsense` = `rubbish`。可以形容某些话是胡扯的

   ```
   That must be a rich man

   It's rubbish / It's nonsense
   ```

4. `It's a waste of time/money` 浪费时间/钱

5. `sb. realize that ...` 某人意识到...。后面通常跟的是宾语从句

   ```
   He realized that she had paid the bill

   They realized that Jack may be sleeping
   ```

6. `keen on doing sth.` 热衷于做某事。`doing` 为动名词

   ```
   I'm keen on swimming

   He is keen on fishing

   They're keen on playing basketball
   ```

7. `tired of doing sth.` 厌倦了做某事。`doing` 为动名词

   ```
   I'm tired of staying here

   He's tired of doing his job

   They're tired of running
   ```

8. `be interested in doing sth.` 对做某事感兴趣。`doing` 为动名词

   ```
   I'm interested in fishing

   He's interested in having whisky

   They're interested in building a great building
   ```

9. `instead of doing sth.` 作为做某事的替代。`doing` 为动名词

   ```
   Instead of asking for a lift, she caught a bus

   Instead of leaving a note, he wrote an email to me
   ```

10. `give up doing sth.` 放弃做某事。`doing` 为动名词

    ```
    He never gives up learning English

    She must give up looking for a better job
    ```

11. `动名词`

    - 一个动词变成了名词去使用

      ```
      中文里也有类似用法

      他正在睡觉
      // `睡觉` 在这里是动词

      睡觉真是一件美事
      // `睡觉` 在这里是名词

      他每天都去钓鱼

      钓鱼是他最大的爱好
      ```

    - 结构：`v. + ing`

      ```
      sleep
      sleeping

      fish
      fishing

      read
      reading
      ```

    - 动名词作为主语。它是单数形式

      ```
      Reading makes me happy

      Sleeping is good for you

      Seeing is believing
      // `seeing` 和 `believing` 都是动名词
      ```

    - 动名词作为宾语。一个句子中只能有一个谓语，因此当遇到 `v. + v.` 的时候，后面的 `v.` 需要变成动名词

      ```
      I like watch TV
      // Error
      // `like` 和 `watch` 都是 `v.`，因此后面的需要变成动名词

      I like watching TV
      // Right


      His hobby is collect stamps
      // Error
      // `is` 和 `collect` 都是 `v.`

      His hobby is collecting stamps
      // Right

      I love read
      // Error

      I love reading
      // Right
      ```

    - 介词后面跟的是动词时，也需要把动词变成动名词

      ```
      He went into the children's bedroom. He didn't make a noise

      He went into the children's bedroom without making a noise
      // `without` 为 `prep.`， 后面跟 `making` 动名词
      // 和上一句表达的意思一致

      Did he go into the children's bedroom without making a noise?


      He listened to the speech without interrupting

      He went to work without having anything for breakfast

      I can't speak to him without being rude

      Congratulations on getting a job!

      Instead of catching fish

      I'm not really interested in fishing

      They've already given up keeping order
      ```
