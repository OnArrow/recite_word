# Lesson 49

1. `to tell you the truth` 和 `to tell the truth` 都表示“说实话；老实说”

   ```
   To tell you the truth, I don't like coffee

   To tell the truth, I do like beef
   ```

2. `either` 一般用于否定句中，`too` 一般用于肯定句和疑问句

   ```
   I like lamb, I like steak, too

   I don't like pea, I don't like bean, either
   ```
