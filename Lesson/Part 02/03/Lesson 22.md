# Lesson 22

## Words

- dream age channel throw

## A glass envelope

```
My daughter, Jane, never dreamed of receiving a letter from a girl of her own age in Holland.

Last year, we were travelling across the Channel and Jane put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a bottle. She threw the bottle into the sea.

She never thought of it again, but ten months later, she received a letter from a girl in Holland.

Both girls write to each other regularly now. However, they have decided to use the post office. Letters will cost a little more, but they will certainly travel faster.
