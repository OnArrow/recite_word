# Lesson 19

1. `What's the matter?` 和 `What's wrong?` 意思相等，都表示“怎么了？”

   ```
   What's the matter? Parents?

   We're cold and hungry

   What's wrong? Children?

   We're tired and thirsty
   ```

2. `sit down`中的`sit`后面的`t`可以省略不读，这种叫做“失去爆破音”（音标`[t]`为爆破音，`[d]`也是）

3. `right`

   ```
   I'm all right
   我没事

   Are you all right?
   你还好吗？
   ```

4. `here`

   ```
   I'm here
   我在这里

   Here you are
   给你

   Here it is
   就是它

   Come here
   到这来

   Here is my ticket
   这是我的票

   Here are our passports
   这是我们的护照
   ```

5. `Who`

   ```
   The boy is thirsty and tired

   Is the boy thirsty and tired?

   Who is thirsty and tired?
   谁又渴又累？
   ```

6. `Whose`

   ```
   These ice creams are mine

   Are these ice creams yours?

   Whose are these ice creams?

   Whose ice creams are these?
   ```

7. `Come`

   ```
   Come in
   进来

   Come on
   快点；来吧

   Come upstairs
   到楼上

   Come and meet our employees
   来见见我们的雇员
   ```

8. `Those`读作“豆子”

9. 在表示商店不营业的时候，通常用`close`多于`shut`

   ```
   We are closed
   我们关门了

   We are shut
   我们关门了
   ```

   ![close](/images/Lesson20/open_and_close.png)

10. `Look at them`

    ```
    Look at them
    看他们
    // 根据“主谓宾”结构，`look at`是谓语，谓语后面跟着宾语，`they`的宾语形式是`them`
    ```

11. 名句

    ```
    You're never too old to start learning, and you're never too young to aim high and achieve great things
    你永远不会太老而不能开始学习，也永远不会太年轻而不能志存高远，成就伟业
    ```

## Tired and thirsty

```
What's the matter, children?

We're tired...

And thirsty, Mum

Sit down here

Are you all right, now?

No, we aren't

Look! There's an ice cream man

Two ice creams, please

Here you are, children

Thanks, Mum

These ice creams are nice

Are you all right, now?

Yes, we are, thank you
```
