  May Day is coming, I'm so happy because my father and mother take me to park this holiday.
  In the park, I see many trees and beautiful flowers. There are many children and many happy playing games, too
  My parents take me to zoo. There are lions、tigers、ducks、snakes、monkeys and so on. I like the moneys best because they are very clever and they make us laugh, how lovely they are!
  I have a good time that day, what a beautiful and happy holiday
