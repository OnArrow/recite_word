# Lesson 87

1. 当用一般疑问句的否定形式来询问时，表示希望得到肯定的回答。可以用“难道”来理解

   ```
   Isn't he lucky?
   他难道不幸运吗？
   // 暗示“他很幸运”

   Didn't you have a crash?

   Isn't that your car?
   ```

2. `drive into` 表示“撞倒”

   ```
   I drove it into a lamp post
   ```

3. `try` 后面一般和 `to + 动词不定式`

   ```
   I'm trying to open the door

   They tried to get it, but failed

   Why don't you try to open it with your hands?
   ```
