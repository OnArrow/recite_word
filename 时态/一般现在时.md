# 一般现在时

## 含义：表示经常发生的动作或经常存在的状态，或者客观事实

```
He often drinks coffee in the afternoon
// 他经常在下午喝咖啡，说明喝咖啡是经常发生的动作，所以为一般现在时

They always run on the grass
// 他们总是在草坪上跑，说明跑上经常发生的动作，所以为一般现在时

I like coffee
// 陈述客观事实，我喜欢咖啡与时间没有关系，这只是一个客观的事实
```

## 规则

1. 当句子为一般现在时句型，并且主语是第三人称单数形式，那么动词就需要变成三单形式

   ```
   He often washes the dishes in the evening
   // 通过`often`可以判断出`wash`这个动作经常发生，所以句型为一般现在时，并且主语`he`为第三人称单数，所以`wash`需要变成三单形式

   They sometimes wash the dishes in the evening
   // 虽然通过`sometimes`可以判断出句型为一般现在时，但主语`they`不是第三人称单数，所以`wash`不需要变三单形式

   She does not like drink milk

   I do not like drink milk

   It usually swims in the river in Summer

   You usually swim in the river in Summer
   ```

2. 一个句子中只会存在一个动词三单形式

   ```
   He does want the piece of beef
   // `does`已经为三单形式了，所以`want`不需要变成三单

   He wants the piece of beef
   ```
