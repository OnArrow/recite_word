- model afford deposit installment price millionaire

## The most expensive model

```
I like this television very much. How much does it cost?

It's the most expensive model in the shop. It costs five hundred pounds

That's too expensive for us. We can't afford all that money

This model's less expensive than that one. It's only three hundred pounds. But, of course, it's not as good as the expensive one

I don't like this model. The other model's more expensive, but it's worth the money

Can we buy it on installments?

Of course. You can pay a deposit of thirty pounds, and then fourteen pounds a month for three years

Do you like it, dear?

I certainly do, but I don't like the price

You always want the best, but we can't afford it. Sometimes you think you're a millionaire!

Millionaires don't buy things on installments!
