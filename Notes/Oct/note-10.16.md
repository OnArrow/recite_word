# Note 10.16

1. 碰到`can` 和 `must` 时，后面的动词不加三单，但另一句需要加

   ```
   Tom must go to the butcher's to get some steak, because he hasn't got any
   // 第一句（以逗号隔开）因为有`must`所以`go`不加三单，但第二句`have`需要变成`has`
   ```

2. `there is` 表示“有”

   ```
   There is a cat on the table
   ```

3. `They also drank cold drinks`

4. `either` 只用于否定句中

   ```
   I don't understand it

   I don't understand it either
   ```
