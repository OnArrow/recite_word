## 与时态结合

### 被动语态 & Simple Present

- 被动语态结构：`be（表示时态） + done（表示被动）`

- 根据被动语态结构，`be`的一般现在时为`am/is/are`，而`done`表示的是动词的过去分词

- 因此，一般现在时的被动语态结构为：`am/is/are + done`

```
Jack cleans the room everyday
杰克每天都打扫房间
// 这是主动语态。杰克是动作的发起者，房间是动作的承受者

The room is cleaned everyday
房间每天都被打扫
// 被动语态。房间被谁打扫不重要，重要的是房间是动作的承受者
// 根据结构，主语为`the room`，那么应该用`is`，`clean`应该变为过去分词`cleaned`

The room is cleaned by Jack everyday
房间每天都被杰克打扫
// 给被动语态的句子添加更多信息
