# Would like

## 含义

1. `would like` 不要分开翻译，把它们当成一个短语翻译成“想要...”。和`want`比较相似，但`would like`表达的语气比较委婉，礼貌

   ```
   Do you want a cup of coffee?

   Would you like a cup of coffee?
   你想要喝一杯咖啡吗？
   // 真诚地想让你喝一杯
   ```

2. `would you like to...?` 可用来表示邀请某人做某事

   ```

   你想去散步吗？

   Would you like to go to the cinema with me?

   Would you like to have dinner with us on Saturday?
   ```

3. 缩写。`I'd like` = `I would like`。`I wouldn't like` = `I would not like`

   ```
   I would like some beef to eat

   I'd like some beef to eat

   You would like to have dinner with the man

   You'd like to have dinner with the man

   He would not like a orange
