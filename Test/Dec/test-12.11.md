Jack might be having a drink with his friend who was from America together

He might not be tired, he must be thirsty

All right, let me tell you, he's ill, so he had to stay in bed for two weeks

He may be looking at out of the window

It may not cost so many

They may not have heard your voice, be loud please, Jack

What may he be doing now?

He may be washing at the moment

I go by Jack

It may not have seen the speed limit

He must have seen the speed limit

He might have gone America for learn

She was worry about you can't swim across the river this morning

Where are you going to on your holidays this year, Gary?

We may go abroad, I'm not sure

My wife wants to go to Egypt. I'd like to go there, too. We can't make up our minds

Will you travel by sea or by air?

We may travel by sea

It's cheaper, isn't it?

It's cheaper, but it takes a long time

I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves

Don't be so sure. We might not go anywhere

My wife always worries too much. Who's going to look after the dog? Who's going to look after the house? Who's going to look after the garden

We have this problem every year. In the end, we stay at home and look after everything
