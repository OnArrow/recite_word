# Lesson 103

## Marks

1. M: `enough` 和 `too`

## Words

- exam pass mathematic question easy enough paper fail answer mark rest difficult hate low cheer guy top clever stupid cheap expensive fresh stale loud high hard sweet soft sour

## The French test

```
How was the exam, Richard?

Not too bad. I think I passed in English and Mathematics. The questions were very easy. How about you, Gary?

The English and Maths papers weren't easy enough for me. I hope I haven't failed

I think I failed the French paper. I could answer sixteen of the questions. They were very easy. But I couldn't answer the rest. They were too difficult for me

French tests are awful, aren't they?

I hate them. I'm sure I've got a low mark

Oh, cheer up! Perhaps we didn't do too badly. The guy next to me wrote his name at the top of the paper

Yes?

Then he sat there and looked at it for three hours! He didn't write a word!
```

## Whole

1. 如果是通过某一个考试，用 `pass`。如果是通过某一个科目，用 `pass in`

   ```
   I think I passed in English and Mathematics
   // 英语和数学是科目，而不是单纯的某次考试

   I will pass the exam next year
   // 具体的某个考试
   ```

2. 当 `paper` 翻译为 `试卷`时，是 `cn.`

   ```
   There are a lot of papers on the desk
   ```

3. `cheer up` 振作起来

4. `next to sb.` 在某人旁边

   ```
   The dog next to Jack was named WangCai

   You could put it down next to the sofa
   ```

5. `enough` 和 `too`

   - `enough` 放在 `adj.` 后面

   - 而 `too` 放在 `adj.` 前面

   ```
   large enough
   足够大

   high enough

   too difficult

   too high

   This bag is big enough

   This question is too difficult
   ```

   - `too` 更多的表达的是负面的感情色彩

   ```
   这女孩太漂亮了，没人敢追她
   // 这里的 `太` 就有点负面感情

   这女孩太漂亮了，我喜欢她
   // 这里的 `太` 就是单纯说 `很，非常` 的意思，不带负面感情
   // 需要结合语境去理解
   ```

   ```
   Math is too difficult
   // `过于难；太难`，有负面的感情（气馁）在里面

   The coat is too big for me to wear
   // `太大了`，导致 `我` 穿不下

   The coat is big enough, it's just suit me
   // 因为没有表达负面感情，所以不用`too`

   The English paper is too easy for me
   // 我已经是大学英语的水平了，所以这个小学的英语试卷对于“我”来说“太”简单了，感觉在浪费我的时间

   The English paper is easy enough for me
   // 我是大学英语的水平，这次的大学英语试卷 `足够` 简单，就是这个试卷的难度对于我来说刚刚好可以轻松拿高分
   ```

6. `too adj. + （for sb.） + to do sth.`

   - 对于某人来说去做某事过于难，这件事情可能完成不了 （含否定的意思在里面）

   ```
   It was too difficult for me to pass
   这考试对于我来说过于难了，我不能通过

   It is too big for him to wear
   这衣服过于大了对他来说，他穿不了

   He is too stupid to pass the exam
   他过于笨了，通不过考试

   The knife is too blunt to cut the beef
   ```

7. `adj. enough + （for sb.） + to do sth.`

   - 对于某人来说可以去做某事，这件事情可以轻易完成 （含肯定的意思在里面）

   ```
   It was easy enough for me to pass
   这考试挺简单的，我可以通过

   It is big enough for him to wear
   这衣服足够大，他刚刚好可以穿

   He is clever enough to pass the exam
   他很聪明，可以通过考试

   The knife is sharp enough to cut the beef
   ```

8. `could`

   - 在大部分情况下，`can` 和 `could` 可以混着用

   - `could` 可以用在现在，也可以用在过去。但 `can` 不能用在过去

   ```
   I can answer this question

   I could answer this question

   I can't swim across the river

   I couldn't swim across the river
   ```

   ```
   Tip: 我前段时间腿受伤了，不方便走路。但现在腿好了，我正在和朋友谈论前几天的事

   I can't go to work on foot the other day
   // 错误
   // 不能用`can't`，因为`不能走路去上班`是前几天的事

   I could't go to work on foot the other day
   // 正确
   ```
