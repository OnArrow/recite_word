## Sold out

```
'The play may begin at any moment,' I said.

'It may have begun already,' Susan answered.

I hurried to the ticket office. 'May I have two tickets please?' I asked.

'I'm sorry, we've sold out,' the girl said.

'What a pity!' Susan exclaimed.

Just then, a man hurried to the ticket office.

'Can I return these two tickets?' he asked.

'Certainly,' the girl said.

I went back to the ticket office at once.

'Could I have those two tickets please?' I asked.

'Certainly,' the girl said. 'but they're for next Wednesday's performance. Do you still want them?'

'I might as well have them,' I said sadly.
