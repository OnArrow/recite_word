## An interesting climate

```
Where do you come from?

I come from England

What's the climate like in your country?

It's mild, but it's not always pleasant

The weather's often cold in the North and windy in the East

It's often wet in the West and sometimes warm in the South

Which seasons do you like best?

I like spring and summer. The days are long and the nights are short. The sun rises early and sets late

I don't like autumn and winter. The days are short and the nights are long. The sun rises late and sets early

Our climate is not very good, but it's certainly interesting

It's our favorite subject of conversation
