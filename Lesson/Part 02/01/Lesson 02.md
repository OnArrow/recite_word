# Lesson 2

## Words

- until outside ring aunt repeat

## Breakfast or lunch?

```
It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometime stay in bed until lunchtime.

Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside.

'What a day!' I thought. 'It's raining again.' Just then, the telephone rang. It was my Aunt Lucy.

'I've just arrived by train,' she said. 'I'm coming to see you.' 'But I'm still having breakfast,' I said.

'What are you doing?' she asked. 'I'm having breakfast,' I repeated. 'Dear me!' she said. 'Do you usually get up so late? It's one o'clock!'
```

## Whole

1. `what a day!` 大致意思：什么破天气

   ```
   It always rains lately, what a day!
   ```

2. `just then` 就在那时

   ```
   Just then, my mother came into my bedroom quickly.
   ```

3. `dear me` 我的天啊！和 `oh my god` 类似

   ```
   Dear me! The dog is running across the garden!
   ```

4. `look out` 当心；小心

   ```
   He must look out for those wire.
   ```

5. `get inside` 进来

   ```
   You'd better not get inside there again.
   ```

6. `get outside` 出去

   ```
   You needn't have gone outside from the museum, you ought to have stayed there.
   ```

7. `现在进行时` 也可以表示即将发生的动作，一般指按计划或者安排好要发生的动作。将来的时间，这个可能是几天后，但通常不会太长

   ```
   I'm meeting my friends.
   我正在见我的朋友
   // 正在发生的事

   We're having a party.
   // 正在发生的事
   ```

   - 如果现在进行时需要用来表示计划打算，那么最好在后面加上未来时间

   ```
   I'm meeting my friends tonight.
   今晚我要见我的朋友
   // 今晚要做的事。按照计划我要见我的朋友
   // `tonight` 未来时间

   We're having a party next week.
   下周我们有一个派对
   // 下周的计划。安排好了下周要发生“开派对”这个动作
   // `next week` 未来时间
   ```

8. `现在进行时` 表示现阶段正在进行的动作，但说话的时候不一定正在进行

   ```
   Jack is driving very fast these days, he doesn't usually drive very fast.
   // `these days`表示现阶段，一段时间。但是说这句话时，Jack不一定正在开得很快

   She's writing a novel.
   // 这段时间里她正在写小说，但是说这句话的她不一定正在写，可能在休息一会
   ```

9. `I'm coming to see you` 是现在进行时表示计划、打算的用法

10. M: `感叹句`

    - 结构：`What + （形容词） + n + （主语 + 谓语）`

    ```
    This is a beautiful picture

    What a beautiful picture this is!
    // 完整的感叹句

    What a beautiful picture!
    // 通常会把主语和谓语省略掉

    It's a terrible day.

    What a terrible day it is!

    What a terrible day!

    They are wonderful actors.

    What wonderful actors they are!

    What wonderful actors!
    // 复数情况下不要加`a/an`
    ```

11. 频率 adv.

    - 例如： `always & sometimes & usually & seldom`

    - 规则：

      1. v. 前面

      2. be 后面

      3. 很多例外情况

    ```
    I never get up early on Sundays.
    // v. 前面
    ```
