This is a photo of me and my family

My mother is sitting on the floor watching television

My father is standing near the window reading a newspaper

My brother is sitting on the armchair listening to the music

And I'm sleeping on the sofa

The cat is running into the box

The dog is eating its bones

There are many birds outside the window

It's a good day today

```
Here is another photo of my family

We are in a valley

There are many flowers、trees、bees and so on here

There are some clouds in the sky, the sun is shining

The birds are flying over the big tree

Those bees are flying across the grass, they are very small

My parents are walking along the river

My brother is swimming across the river

My cat and I are running on the river

The dog is running after a bird
