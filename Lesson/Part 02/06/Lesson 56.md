## Faster than sound

```
Once a year, a race is held for old cars. A lot of cars entered for this race last year and there was a great deal of excitement just before it began.

One of the most handsome cars was a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost.

The most unusual car was a Benz which had only three wheels. Built in 1885, it was the oldest car taking part.

After a great many loud explosions, the race began. Many of the cars broke down on the course and some drivers spent more time under their cars than in them!

A few cars, however, completed the race. The winning car reached a speed of forty miles an hour - much faster than any of its rivals.

It sped downhill at the end of the race and its driver had a lot of trouble trying to stop it.

The race gave everyone a great deal of pleasure. It was very different from modern car races but no less exciting.
