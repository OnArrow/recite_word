# Lesson 115

## Words

```
anyone knock everything quiet impossible invite anything nothing lemonade joke
```

## Whole

1. 不定代词

   - 不太确定指向的代词

   | every      | no      | any      | some      |
   | ---------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
   | everyone   | no one  | anyone   | someone   |
   | everybody  | nobody  | anybody  | somebody  |
   | everything | nothing | anything | something |
   | everywhere | nowhere | anywhere | somewhere |

   - `everyone` 往往可以代表每一个人或每一个事物

   - `everybody` 特指每一个人

   - `everything` 特指每一个事物

   - 不定代词作主语的时候通常表示单数，后面跟`is`

     ```
     Everyone is pretty

     Everybody wants to have a drink

     Everything is possible

     Someone isn't clever
     ```

   - 当不确定是一个人还是一些人的时候，只要用了`someone`就默认为一个人，此时为单数

     ```
     Someone is knocking at the door
     // 不确定敲门的人是一个人还是多个人

     Someone are knocking at the door
     // 此时已经确定有两个人在敲门
     ```

   - `any`开头的不定代词一般用于否定句和疑问句

2. `be quiet` 安静

   - 像这样的`be`开头的短语，可以理解为完整的句子是`you will be quiet`。因为想让你在将来的时间里面“安静”，所以用`will`，同时因为`will`后面的`be动词`必须是原型，所以为`be quiet`。其实理解为`must`也可以，因为`must`后面跟的`be动词`也必须是原型

   ```
   Be quiet

   You will be quiet
   // 这里的`be`就是由`will`决定的
   // `you are quiet`你是安静的。`you will be quiet`你将是安静的

   You must be quiet

   Be careful

   You will be careful

   You must be careful
   ```

3. 当我们从某个东西穿过去看时，穿一定要用`through`这个介词

   ```
   I'm looking at the cat through the window

   He's just seen a strange person through the window
   ```

4. `across` 和 `through`

   - `across` 往往不是从内部穿过，往往是从表面或者上面穿过

   ```
   The car is running across the garden
   ```

   - `through` 往往是从物体的内部穿过

5. `have something to drink` 喝点东西

   - 后面的`drink`可换成其它合适的`v.`

   ```
   have something to eat
   ```

## Knock, knock

```
Isn't there anyone at home?

I'll knock again, Helen. Everything's very quiet. I'm sure there's no one at home

But that's impossible. Carol and Tom invited us to lunch. Look through the window

Can you see anything?

Nothing at all

Let's try the back door

Look! Everyone's in the garden

Hello, Helen. Hello, Jim

Everybody wants to have lunch in the garden. It's nice and warm out here

Come and have something to drink

Thanks, Carol. May I have a glass of beer please?

Beer? There's none left

You can have some lemonade

Lemonade!

Don't believe her, Jim. She's only joking. Have some beer!
```
