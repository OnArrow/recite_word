# Lesson 29

## Words

- taxi Pilatus land plough lonely Welsh roof block flat desert

## Taxi!

```
Captain Ben Fawcett has bought an unusual taxi and has begun a new service.

The 'taxi' is a small Swiss aeroplane called a 'Pilatus Porter'. This wonderful plane can carry seven passengers.

The most surprising thing about it, however, is that it can land anywhere: on snow, water, or even on a ploughed field.

Captain Fawcett's first passenger was a doctor who flew from Birmingham to a lonely village in the Welsh mountains.

Since then, Captain Fawcett has flown passengers to many unusual places. Once he landed on the roof of a block of flats and on another occasion, he landed in a deserted car park.

Captain Fawcett has just refused a strange request from a businessman. The man wanted to fly to Rockall, a lonely island in the Atlantic Ocean, but Captain Fawcett did not take him because the trip was too dangerous

## Whole

1. `take a taxi` 打车

   ```
   The taxi you took last night broke down this morning
   // `that` 可以省略，因为这里替代的是宾语。`you took the taxi` 中的 `the taxi` 是宾语，`that` 是替代它的

   If you take a taxi there, then you don't have to get up so early
   ```

2. `lonely` 更多用在表示 `孤单的`，而不是 `偏僻的`

3. `roof` 通常指的是 `房顶的外侧部分`，`ceiling` 才是指 `天花板。房顶内侧部分`

4. `put away` 收起

5. `is that it can land anywhere` 是一个宾语从句。结合前文来看，完整的应该是 `the most surprising thing about it is that it can land anywhere`

6. `done(v. 的过去分词)` 做定语

   - 当 `done` 做定语时，类似于 `adj.`

     ```
     a broken machine
     一台坏掉的机器
     // `broken` 为 `break` 的过去分词

     a ploughed field
     一块耕过的田

     a deserted car park
     一个废弃的停车场
     ```

   - 表示 `被动完成`

     ```
     the cup that has been broken

     a broken cup
     一个被损坏的杯子
     // 等价于上面


     water that has been boiled

     boiled water
     被烧开的水
     ```

   - 偶尔表示 `主动完成`，但这种情况比较少见

     ```
     a captain who has retired

     a retired captain
     一个退休了的队长
     // 是队长主动退休


     a man who has married

     a married man
     结婚了的男人
     // 男人当时是主动结婚的
     ```

   - `done` 做定语时在句子中的位置

     - `done + n.`。当 `done` 用来修饰一个名词时，放在名词的前面

       ```
       The plane landed on a ploughed field

       The broken watch was thrown away by the man
       ```

     - `done` 用来引导一个短语时，放在名词的后面；定语后置

       ```
       The 'taxi' is a small Swiss airplane called a 'Pilatus Porter'
       // `called a Pilatus Porter` 为 `called` 引导的短语，因此 `called` 放在名词 `Swiss airplane` 后面
       ```
