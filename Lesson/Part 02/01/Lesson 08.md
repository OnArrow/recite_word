## The best and the worst

```
Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town. Nearly everybody enters for 'The Nicest Garden Competition' each year, but Joe wins every time.

Bill Frith's garden is larger than Joe's. Bill works harder than Joe and grows more flowers and vegetables, but Joe's garden is more interesting.

He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool. I like gardens too, but I do not like hard work.

Every year I enter for the garden competition too, and I always win a little prize for the worst garden in the town!
