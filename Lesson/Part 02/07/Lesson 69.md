## But not murder!

```
I was being tested for a driving licence for the third time. I had been asked to drive in heavy traffic and had done so successfully.

After having been instructed to drive out of town, I began to acquire confidence. Sure that I had passed, I was almost beginning to enjoy my test.

The examiner must have been pleased with my performance, for he smiled and said, 'Just one more thing, Mr.Eames. Let us suppose that a child suddenly crosses the road in front of you.'

'As soon as I tap on the window, you must stop within five feet.' I continued driving and after some time, the examiner tapped loudly.

Though the sound could be heard clearly, it took me a long time to react. I suddenly pressed the brake pedal hard and we were both thrown forward.

The examiner looked at me sadly. 'Mr. Eames,' he said, in a mournful voice, 'You have just killed that child!'
