## An exciting trip

```
I have just received a letter from my brother, Tim. He is in Australia. He has been there for six months.

Tim is an engineer. He is working for a big firm and he has already visited a great number of different places in Australia.

He has just bought an Australian car and has gone to Alice Springs, a small town in the centre of Australia.

He will soon visit Darwin. From there, he will fly to Perth.

My brother has never been abroad before, so he is finding this trip very exciting.
```

## Whole

1. `现在完成时`表达的意思比较含蓄，而`一般过去式`表达的意思比较直接

   ```
   你想和我们一起吃晚饭吗？

   我刚吃过一点东西
   // `现在完成时`，潜台词就是“不用了，我吃过了”，拒绝别人的邀请

   我下午五点半时吃了顿饭
   // `一般过去时`，我吃过饭了，不吃了，拒绝别人的邀请
   ```

2. `现在完成时`和`一般过去时`并不是泾渭分明的，它们大多数时候可以互相替换
