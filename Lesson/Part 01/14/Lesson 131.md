# Lesson 131

1. `may/might` 表示现在推测

   - 表示推测，但是这个推测的可信度比较低，对现在的发生的事的肯定推测：可能是

   - 用法和`must`基本相同。但是变为否定时，不需要换成其它单词，只需要在后面加上`not`

   - 虽然`might`是`may`的过去式，但在表示推测时两者混用完全没问题，不需要特别区分

   ```
   这件外套可能是我的
   // 可信度比较低
   // 对应`may`

   这件外套一定是我的
   // 可信度高
   // 对应`must`

   这件外套是我的
   // 肯定句
   ```

   ```

   // `might`可以用在现在，可以和`may`互相替换

   ```
   Where is she from?

   She may be from China
   // 可信度低

   // 注意这里的`was`，表示问的是他曾经的工作

   He may have been a mechanic

   He must have been an engineer

   He was a doctor
   ```

3. 在祈使句中，`be`动词的否定句要用`don't be`。这种结构常常用于劝告

   Don't be so sure

   Don't be quick
   ```

4. `abroad` 组成的短语

We may go abroad. I'm not sure

Will you travel by sea or by air?

We may travel by sea

It may be cheaper, but it takes a long time

I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves

Don't be so sure. We might not go anywhere

We have this problem every year. In the end, we stay at home and look after everything!
