## A polite request

```
If you park your car in the wrong place, a traffic policeman will soon find it. You will be very lucky if he lets you go without a ticket. However, this does not always happen. Traffic police are sometimes very polite.

During a holiday in Sweden, I found this note on my car: 'Sir, we welcome you to our city.'

'This is a "No Parking" area. You will enjoy your stay here if you pay attention to our street signs. This note is only a reminder.'

If you receive a request like this, you cannot fail to obey it!
