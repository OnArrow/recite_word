## In or out?

```
Our dog, Rex, used to sit outside our front gate and bark. Every time he wanted to come into the garden he would bark until someone opened the gate.

As the neighbours complained of the noise, my husband spent weeks training him to press his paw on the latch to let himself in. Rex soon became an expert at opening the gate.

However, when I was going out shopping last week, I noticed him in the garden near the gate. This time he was barking so that someone would let him out!

Since then, he has developed another bad habit. As soon as he opens the gate from the outside, he comes into the garden and waits until the gate shuts.

Then he sits and barks until someone lets him out. After this he immediately lets himself in and begins barking again.

Yesterday my husband removed the gate and Rex got so annoyed we have not seen him since.

9. 文中 `Rex got so annoyed we have not seen him since` 这句话应该是 `so...that...` 句型，但是 `that` 被省略掉了。`so...that...` 句型中 `that` 是可以被省略的。因此完整的句子如下

   ```
   Rex got so annoyed that we have not seen him since.
   ```

10. M: `get done` 也可以表示被动，和 `be done` 一致。但 `get done` 更偏向于口语表达

    ```
    Carrots were eaten by the rabbit.

    Carrots got eaten by the rabbit.
    // 和上一句等价
    ```

    - [get 的被动用法](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2006/06/get-passive.html)

11. M: `so that` 引导的 `目的状语从句`

    - 通常可以理解为 `以便，为了`

      ```
      我每天都写日记，这样我就不用去记住每一件事
      // `写日记` 的目的就是为了 `不用去记住每一件事`

      警察每天都在维护秩序，以便城市能够正常运转
      // `维护秩序` 的目的就是为了 `城市正常运转`
      ```

    - 和 `so that` 类似的还有: `to`, `in order to`, `so as to`, `in order that`

    ```
    I wrote them down in my diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
    我把它们写在我的日记里，以便我不用去记住它们
    // `so that` 连接两个句子

    So that I wouldn't have to remember, I wrote them down in my diary.
