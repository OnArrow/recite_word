## Do the English speak English?

```
I arrived in London at last. The railway station was big, black and dark. I did not know the way to my hotel, so I asked a porter.

I not only spoke English very carefully, but very clearly as well. The porter, however, could not understand me.

I repeated my question several times and at last he understood. He answered me, but he spoke neither slowly nor clearly.

'I am a foreigner,' I said. Then he spoke slowly, but I could not understand him. My teacher never spoke English like that!

The porter and I looked at each other and smiled. Then he said something and I understood it. 'You'll soon learn English!' he said.

I wonder. In England, each person speaks a different language. The English understand each other, but I don't understand them! Do they speak English?
```
