While I was having my breakfast this morning, my cat jumped suddenly onto my table

I was having a bath when someone knocked at the door

While I was putting on shoes this morning, the postman gave a letter to me from my mother

When I was walking to school this morning, I saw a accident

While our class was having an English lesson, I spoke to my classmate

Just as I was leaving the classroom after class, it rained heavily

I met my friend while I was walking home yesterday

Suddenly my brother went into my bedroom when I was lying in bed last night

I was walking in the park when it started to rain

The water boiled over when I was doing my homework at home

We heard someone was crying outside while I was watching television with my friends

I left my office after I had finished my work

I had washed my hands before I had dinner

I wrote the answer on the paper after I had answered the question

She slipped and fell down after she had got off the bus

I had washed those dishes before I watched television

Had you washed those dishes before you watched television?

Yes, I had

When had you washed those dished?

Before I watched television
