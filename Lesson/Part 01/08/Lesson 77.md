Good morning, Mr. Croft

Good morning, nurse, I want to see the dentist, please

Do you have an appointment?

No, I don't

Is it urgent?

Yes, it is. It's very urgent. I feel awful. I have a terrible toothache

Can you come at 10 a.m. on Monday, April 24th?

I must see the dentist now, nurse

The dentist is very busy at the moment. Can you come at 2 p.m.?

That's very late. Can the dentist see me now?

I'm afraid that he can't, Mr. Croft. Can't you wait till this afternoon?

I can wait, but my toothache can't!
