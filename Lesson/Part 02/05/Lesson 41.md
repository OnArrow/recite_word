## Do you call that a hat?

```
'Do you call that a hat?' I said to my wife.

'You needn't be so rude about it,' my wife answered as she looked at herself in the mirror.

I sat down on one of those modern chairs with holes in it and waited. We had been in the hat shop for half an hour and my wife was still in front of mirror.

'We mustn't buy things we don't need,' I remarked suddenly. I regretted saying it almost at once.

'You needn't have said that,' my wife answered. 'I needn't remind you of that terrible tie you bought yesterday.'

'I find it beautiful,' I said. 'A man can never have too many ties.'

'And a woman can't have too many hats,' she answered.

Ten minutes later we walked out of the shop together. My wife was wearing a hat that looked like a lighthouse!
```

## Whole

1. `A man can never have too many ties` 一个男人永远有不会有过多的领带。`have` 和 `too` 都有否定的意思。双重否定表示肯定，男人的领带永远不嫌多

2. `regret doing sth.` 后悔做某事

   ```
   I regretted helping him on the street yesterday morning

   He regretted drinking the milk in the fridge

   I think he regrets telling that story about him
   ```

3. `call on sb.` 拜访某人

   ```
   I'll be calling on him next Saturday.
   ```

4. `need`

   - `need` 既可以当做 `v.`，也可以当作 `modal verb`

   - `need` 如果要当作 `modal verb` 来用，基本上是用于 `否定句/疑问句`。`肯定句` 是当成 `v.`

   - `needn't do` & `needn't have done`

     - `needn't do` 不需要

       ```
       今天天气很好，太阳很大。小明对小红说：“你不需要带伞出门”
       // 太阳很好，不可能会下雨的。所以不需要带伞
       ```

       - `needn't` 和 `don't need to do`、`don't have to do` 表达意思基本一致

       ```
       You needn't take the umbrella
       // 没下雨，没必要带
       // `need` 作为情态动词使用

       It's Sunday today, I needn't go to work

       Her boyfriend has already paid the bill, she needn't pay it
       ```

     - `needn't have done` 本不必如此。但事情已经发生了，有后悔的语言效果

       ```
       今天天气一般，多云，也没有乌云。但天气预报说有10%的概率会下雨，小红看了下天气，觉得可能会下，就带伞出门了。结果一整天都没下雨，小红对自己说：“我本来没必要带伞出门的”
       // 本来下雨就是一件非常小概率的事情，不带伞也没关系。但 `带伞` 这个事情已经发生了。有点后悔带了伞

       小明因为没钱，把他的车卖了。结果第二天他买的那张彩票就中奖了，他本没有必要去卖掉他的车的
       // `卖车` 这件事已经发生了。小明后悔了

       小明去旅游时带上了一个很重的相机，结果到最后都没拍到什么好的照片，他本不必带这个相机去旅游的
       ```

       Mary bought some eggs when she went shopping. When she got home, she found that she already had plenty of eggs
