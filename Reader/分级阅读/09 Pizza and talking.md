# Pizza and talking

1. When I was about fifteen years old, my favourite books and films were all love stories.

2. The stories were all the same. There was a man (the hero) and a woman (the heroine). They met. But there was always a problem which meant they could not be together at first. Perhaps the hero was hurt by love in the past and didn't want a girlfriend now. Or the heroine had an important job and didn't have time for a boyfriend. Anyway, these books or films always finish in the same way. The hero and the heroine know that they are in love, so the problems aren't important/
