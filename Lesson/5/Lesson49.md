# Lesson 49

1. `to tell you the truth` 和 `to tell the truth` 都表示“说实话；老实说”

   ```
   To tell you the truth, I don't like coffee

   To tell the truth, I do like beef
   ```

2. `either` 一般用于否定句中，`too` 一般用于肯定句和疑问句

   ```
   I like lamb, I like steak, too

   I don't like pea, I don't like bean, either
   ```

3. `sheep` 表示“羊”，而 `lamb` 表示“小羊”。如果没有特定指羊的大小的话，一般使用 `sheep`

   ```
   Those sheep are in the grassland

   This lamb is really small
   ```

4. `How do you like your steak?` 你想要你的牛排几分熟？

   ```
   How do you like your steak?

   Rare
   两三成熟

   Medium
   五六成熟

   Well done
   全熟
   ```

5. 动词的第三人称单数

   ```
   I want this job

   You want this job

   He wants this job
   // 当动词搭配第三人称单数时，自己需要变成第三人称单数。`want` -> `wants`

   He does want this job
   他确实想要这份工作
   // 一个句子只存在一个谓语动词（这里是`does`）

   She likes grapes

   She does like grapes

   It loves it

   It does love it

   He washes the dishes every day
   // `every day` 说明每天都洗，习惯性动作，所以时态为一般现在时，同时，主语为第三人称单数，所以`wash`就要变成第三人称单数形式

   He doesn't wash the dishes every day
   ```

6. 名句

   ```
   If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember everything
   如果你说实话，你就不必记住所有的事情
   ```

## At the butcher's

```
Do you want any meat today, Mrs.Bird?

Yes, please

Do you want beef or lamb?

Beef, please

This lamb's very good

I like lamb, but my husband doesn't

What about some steak? This is a nice piece

Give me that piece, please. And a pound of mince, too

Do you want a chicken, Mrs.Bird? They are very nice

No, thank you. My husband likes steak, but he doesn't like chicken

To tell you the truth, Mrs.Bird, I don't like chicken, either!
```
