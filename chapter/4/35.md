# Our village

```
This is a photograph of our village

Our village is in a valley

It is between two hills

The village is on a river

Here is another photograph of the village

My wife and I are walking along the banks of the river

We are on the left

There is a boy in the water

He's swimming across the river

Here is another photograph

This is the school building

It's beside the park

The park is on the right

The children are coming out of the building

Some of them are going into the park
