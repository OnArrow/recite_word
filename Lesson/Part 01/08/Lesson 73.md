## The way to King street

```
Last week Mrs. Mills went to London

She does not know London very well, and she lost her way

Suddenly, she saw a man near a bus stop

'I can ask him the way.' she said to herself

'Excuse me,' she said. 'Can you tell me the way to King Street, please?'

The man smiled pleasantly. He did not understand English!

He spoke German. He was a tourist

Then he put his hand into his pocket, and took out a phrasebook

He opened the book and found a phrase

He read the phrase slowly. 'I am sorry,' he said. 'I do not speak English'
