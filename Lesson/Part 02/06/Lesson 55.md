## Not a gold mine

```
Dreams of finding lost treasure almost came true recently.

A new machine called 'The revealer' has been invented and it has been used to detect gold which has been buried in the ground.

The machine was used in a cave near the seashore where - it is said - pirates used to hide gold.

The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it. Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure.

The leader of the party was examining the soil near the entrance to the cave when the machine showed that there was gold under the ground.

Very excited, the party dug a hole two feet deep. They finally found a small gold coin which was almost worthless.

The party then searched the whole cave thoroughly but did not find anything except an empty tin trunk.

In spite of this, many people are confident that 'The Revealer' may reveal something of value fairly soon.

18. `it is said` 据说

19. M: `would do` 过去重复发生的动作

    1. `would` 后面只能跟具体的动作，而不能跟状态

       ```

       // 错误。有一只狗，`有`是一个状态，而不是具体的动作

       He would be the head of the business company.

       // 过去常常吸烟，可能现在还继续吸烟，也可能现在不吸了，只表达过去，不涉及到现在

       When Jack was angry, he used to walk out of the room.
       ```

20. M: `where` 引导的定语从句

    - 用法基本和 `that`, `who` 引导的定语从句一致。`where` 替代的是 `地点`

    ```
    The hotel wasn't very clean.

    We stayed there.

    The hotel where we stayed wasn't very clean.
    我们住过的酒店不是非常干净
    // `where` 替代了第二句中的地点 `there`
    // `where we stayed` 为定语从句，修饰 `the hotel`

    I was born in that town.

    I recently went back to the town where I was born.

    ```

21. M: `whose` 引导的定语从句

    - 用法基本和 `that`, `who` 引导的定语从句一致。`whose` 替代的是 `谁的`，物主代词。如 `his`, `her`, `their`

      ```
      I met a man.

      His wife is an English teacher.

      I met a man whose wife is an English teacher.
      我遇到那个他的老婆是个英语老师的男人
      // `whose` 替代了第二句中的 `his`
      // `whose wife is an English teacher` 为定语从句，修饰 `a man` 。他的老婆是个英语老师的


      I helped some people.

      Their car had broken down.

      I helped some people whose car had broken down.
      我帮助了一些他们的车坏了的人
      // 什么样的人，`他们的车坏了` 的人
      ```

    - 和 `who` 引导的定语从句做对比

      ```
      I met a man.

      He knows you.

      I met a man who knows you.
      我遇到了那个认识你的人
      // 什么样的人，`认识你` 的人

      I met a man whose sister knows you.
      我遇到了那个他的姐姐认识你的人
