## Our new neighbor

```
Nigel is our new next-door neighbor

He's a pilot. He was in the R.A.F.

He will fly to New York next month

The month after next he'll fly to Tokyo

At the moment, he's in Madrid

He flew to Spain a week ago

He'll return to London the week after next

He's only forty-one years old, and he has already been to nearly every country in the world

Nigel is a very lucky man

But his wife isn't very lucky

She usually stays at home!
