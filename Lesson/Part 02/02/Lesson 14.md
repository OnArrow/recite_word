# Lesson 14

## Words

- amusing experience wave lift reply language journey apart

## Do you speak English?

```
I had an amusing experience last year. After I had left a small village in the south of France, I drove on to the next town.

On the way, a young man waved to me. I stopped and he asked me for a lift. As soon as he had got into the car, I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language.

Apart from a few words, I do not know any French at all. Neither of us spoke during the journey.

I had nearly reached the town, when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, 'Do you speak English?' As I soon learnt, he was English himself!
