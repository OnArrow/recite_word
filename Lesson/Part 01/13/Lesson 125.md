1. M: `have to` 不得不

## Words

```
water terribly dry nuisance mean surprise immediately
```

## Tea for two

```
Can't you come in and have tea now, Peter?

Not yet. I must water the garden first

Do you have to water it now?

I'm afraid I must. Look at it! It's terribly dry

What a nuisance!

Last summer it was very dry, too. Don't you remember? I had to water it every day

Well, I'll have tea by myself

That was quick! Have you finished already?

Yes. Look out of the window

It's raining! That means you don't need to water the garden

That was a pleasant surprise. It means I can have tea, instead
```

## Whole

1. `have to`

   - 含义：不得不/必须

   - 和 `had better` 一样，不要把 `have to` 分开翻译，当成一个词来翻译

   - 在不同时态下，`have to` 也需要跟随时态做出变化

   ```
   I have to leave now
   现在我不得不离开
   // 一般现在时

   I don't have to leave now

   Do you have to leave now?

   She has to leave now

   She doesn't have to leave now

   He will have to leave tonight
   他今晚不得不离开
   // 一般将来时

   Will he have to leave tonight?

   I had to work for my family when I was 18
   我18岁的时候我不得不为了家人去工作赚钱
   // 一般过去时

   I didn't have to work for my family when I was 18

   Did you have to work for your family?
   ```

2. `have to` 和 `must`

   - `have to` 更多的表示 `客观情况`，如他人的命令或者章程

   - `must` 更多的表示 `主观意愿`，就是自己的想法

   ```
   某个聚会很无聊，你实在不想待下去了，所以找借口说 `我吃饱了，我必须要走了`
   // 这是主观的意愿。我自己想走的

   某个聚会很有趣，你想一直玩到晚上11点，但9点的时候你老婆打电话来叫你回家，所以此时你不得不回家
   // 主观上不想走，但客观上老婆已经叫回家了，所以 `不得不回`，尽管主观上不情愿
   ```

   ```
   This is a terrible party, we really must go home

   This is a lovely place, but I have to go home because of my wife
   ```

3. `terribly` 和 `very`

   - `very` 是一个比较偏中性的表示 `非常，很` 的副词

   - `terribly` 是偏向于糟糕，不好的表示 `非常，很` 的副词

   ```
   The land is very dry
   // 没有表达什么情感，就是简单地陈述客观事实

   The land is terribly dry
   // 地面很干旱了，情况有点糟

   Why is it terribly dry this summer?
   ```

4. `by myself` 我自己。`by himself`他自己。`by themselves` 他们自己。表达的都是相同的意思

   ```
   I'll have tea by myself

   They are cooking by themselves
   ```
