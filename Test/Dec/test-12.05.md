Do you like this dress? madam

I like the color very much, it's a lovely dress, but it's too small for me

What about this one? It's a lovely dress, it's very smart. Short skirts are in fashion now. Would you like to try it?

All right

I'm afraid this green one is too small for me as well, it's smaller than the blue one

I don't like the color either. It doesn't suit me at all. I think the blue one is prettier

Could you show me another blue dress? I want a dress like that one, but it must be my size

I'm afraid I haven't got a large dress. This is the largest dress in the shop

I'm sorry, I've just broken that vase

Oh, don't say sorry, it doesn't matter

Tom came Jack's room, said 'What a mess!'

It's pity that he didn't get a high mark

There is a little money in my pocket, I can buy that toy to my child with the money

There is little money in my pocket, I can't buy my child a toy with the money

I've got a little water to give the cat for drink

I've got little water to water that flower out of the window

I've got a large enough place for him to use

I've got a few house for sell

Shall I make some coffee, Jane?

That's a good idea, Charlotte

It's ready. Do you want any milk?

Just a little, please

What about some surge? Two teaspoonfuls?

No, less than that. One and a half teaspoonfuls, that's enough for me

That was very nice

Would you like more?

Yes, please

I'd like a cigarette, may I have one?

Of course, I think there are a few in that box

I'm afraid it's empty

What a pity

It doesn't matter

Have a biscuit instead, eat more and smoke less

That's very good advice
