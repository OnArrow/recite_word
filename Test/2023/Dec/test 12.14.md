The room is cleaned by Jack everyday

The house is sold

That vases are dropped

The errors are thrown in the console

The sun rises at seven a.m. regularly

Is he invited to join Jack's party?

He's invited to join Jack's party

What's he invited to join?

I'm taller than him

I'm the tallest person I've ever seen

The vase was put on the shelf by someone

The windows were opened by someone last night

The building was broken

The buildings which in the city were destroyed by something

These displays were turned on by someone, no one knew what they were going to do

I bought enough wash powder during the activity

The money is too less for me to buy it

You'd better not make up your face, the time is urgent

Last week, my four-years-old daughter, Sally, was invited to a children's party

I decided to take her by train

Sally was very excited because she had never traveled on a train before

She sat near the window and asked questions about everything which she saw. Suddenly, a middle-aged lady got on the train and sat opposite Sally

'Hello, little girl' she said

Sally didn't answer, but looked at her curiously

The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large, funny hat

After the train had left the station, the lady opened her handbag and took out her powder compact

She then began make up her face

'Why are you doing that?' Sally asked

'To make myself beautiful' the lady answered

She put away the compact and smiled kindly

'But you are still ugly' Sally said

Sally was amused, but I was very embarrassed

I live in a very old town which is surrounded by beautiful woods, it's a famous beauty spot

on Sundays, hundreds of people come from the city to see our town and to walk through the woods

Visitors have been asked to keep the woods clean and tidy

Litter baskets have been placed under the trees, but people still throw their rubbish everywhere

Last Wednesday, I went for a walk in the woods, what I saw made me very sad, I counted seven old cars and three refrigerators

The litter baskets were empty and the ground was covered with pieces of paper, cigarette ends, old tyres, empty bottle and rusty tins

Among the rubbish, I found a sign which said 'Anyone who leaves litter in these woods will be prosecuted'
