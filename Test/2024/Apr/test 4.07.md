I was nervous about I had been late for the lesson

It's cheaper than that one, I can afford it

It's more expensive than that one, I couldn't afford it, but now can

Sorry to interrupt, Jack, your leader will see you in two minutes, please prepare for that

I could use some extra hand

I'm very hungry, it's my turn

Get out, get out, my turn had come

keep order

Keep order, keep order, don't speak loudly, don't smoke here, you will be fined else
