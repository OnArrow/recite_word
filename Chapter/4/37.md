# Making a bookcase

```
You're working hard, George. What are you doing?

I'm making a bookcase

Give me that hammer please, Dan

Which hammer? This one?

No, not that one, the big one

Here you are

Thank you, Dan

What are you going to do now, George?

I'm going to paint it

What color are you going to paint it?

I'm going to paint it pink

Pink!

This bookcase isn't for me

It's for my daughter, Susan

Pink's her favorite color
