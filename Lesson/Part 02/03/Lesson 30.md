# Lesson 30

## Words

- polo Wayle cut row kick towards nearly sight

## Football or polo

```
The Wayle is a small river that cuts across the park near my home. I like sitting by the Wayle on fine afternoons.

It was warm last Sunday, so I went and sat on the river bank as usual. Some children were playing games on the bank and there were some people rowing on the river.

Suddenly, one of the children kicked a ball very hard and it went towards a passing boat.

Some people on the bank called out to the man in the boat, but he did not hear them. The ball struck him so hard that he nearly fell into the water.

I turned to look at the children, but there weren't any in sight: they had all run away!

The man laughed when he realize what had happened. He called out to the children and threw the ball back to the bank.
```

## Whole

1. `kick his ass` 揍他一顿。并不单单指 `屁股`

   ```
   He kicked his ass very angrily.
   ```

2. `in sight` 视野内。 `out of sight` 视野外

   ```
   No one is in my sight.

   Everyone is out of my sight.
   ```

3. `call out to sb.` 冲某人大声喊叫。类似于 `shout`

   ```
   He called out to that girl who sat on the river bank.
   ```

4. `to do sth.` 和 `doing sth.` 基本一致

   ```
   I don't intend staying long.

   I don't intend to stay long.
   ```

5. `doing(v. 的现在分词)` 做定语

   - 当 `doing` 做定语时，类似于形容词

     ```
     a fishing man.
     一个正在钓鱼的人

     a passing car.
     一辆正在经过的车

     a building house.
     一个正在建造的房子
     ```

   - 表示 `主动完成`

     ```
     the ship that is sinking.

     the sinking ship.
     正在沉没的船
     // 等价于上面


     the sun that is rising.

     the rising sun.


     the child who is sleeping.

     the sleeping child.
     ```

   - `doing` 做定语时在句子中的位置和 `done` 一致

     - `doing + n.`。当 `doing` 用来修饰一个名词时，放在名词的前面

       ```
       The swimming kid has been struck by the ball.

       The water that is in the glass dropped down on the sleeping man.
       ```

     - `doing` 用来引导一个短语时，放在名词的后面；定语后置

       ```
       I like the girl dancing with that guy.
       // `dancing with that guy` 为 `dancing` 引导的短语，因此 `dancing` 放在名词 `girl` 后面

       There were some people rowing on the river.
       ```

6. `prep.` 引导的短语做定语时，需要放在被修饰的名词后面

   ```
   the park near my home.
   我家附近的公园
   // `near my home` 是 `near` 引导的短语，因此放在 `park` 后面

   some people on the bank.

   the man in the boat.
   ```
