## Jumbo versus the police

```
Last Christmas, the circus owner, Jimmy Gates, decided to take some presents to a children's hospital.

Dressed up as Father Christmas and accompanies by a 'guard of honour' of six pretty girls, he set off down the main street of the city riding a baby elephant called Jumbo.

He should have known that the police would never allow this sort of thing. A policeman approached Jimmy and told him he ought to have gone along a side street as Jumbo was holding up the traffic.

Though Jimmy agreed to go at once, Jumbo refused to move. Fifteen policemen had to push very hard to get him off the main street. The police had a difficult time, but they were most amused.

'Jumbo must weight a few tons,' said a policeman afterwards, 'so it was fortunate that we didn't have to carry him.'

'Of course, we should arrest him, but as he has a good record, we shall let him off this time.'
```
