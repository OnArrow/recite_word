## Whole

1. `What's the matter with ...` 常用来询问人或事物的状况

   ```
   What's the matter with him?
   他怎么了？

   What's the matter with your son?

   What's the matter with the dog?
   ```

2. `must` 在语法结构上比较像 `can`。`must` 后面跟的也是动词原形

   ```
   We must call a doctor

   Must we call a doctor?

   Yes, we must

   What must he do?

   He must go to hospital
   ```

   ```
   We can call a doctor

   Can we call a doctor?

   Yes, we can

   What can he do?

   He can go to hospital
   ```

3. 一般来说动词后面都加名词，但是感官动词后面可以加形容词

   - 感官动词：`feel`, `sound`, `smell`, `taste`, `look`

     ```
     I feel ill

     It sounds terrible

     It smells great

     The apple tastes nice

     He looks tired
     ```

4. 表达生病时通常用 `have + 病的名称`

   ```
   have an toothache
   牙痛

   have a headache
   头痛

   have an earache
   耳朵痛

   have a temperature
   发烧

   have a cold
   感冒

   have a stomachache
   肚子痛

   I have a temperature
   我发烧了
   ```

5. 当 `have` 后跟一些名词，往往可以做 `动词短语`

   ```
   have a conversation
   交谈
   // 如果按字面翻译，应该译为 `有一个谈话`，这里的 `谈话` 实际上是一个 `n.`
   // 当前面是 `have` 时，应该理解为 `交谈`，是一个动词短语

   have lunch
   吃午餐
   // 同样，这里不能翻译为 `有一个午餐`，应该理解为引申意 `吃午餐` 这个动词

   have dinner
   吃晚餐
   ```

6. 当表示 `服用药物` 时，中文习惯直接说 `吃药`，但不能直接翻译成英文 `eat medicine`。当用英文表示 `吃药` 时，应该用 `take`

   ```
   take an aspirin
   服用阿司匹林

   take some medicine
   服用一些药
   ```
