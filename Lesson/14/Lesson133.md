# Lesson 133

1. 直接引语时态变化

   - 总结：当主句为一般过去时的时候，间接引语一定要后退一个时态

   - 当主句为一般过去时，并且直接引语为一般现在时，那么间接引语就要变为一般过去时

   ```
   5分钟前：
   杰克：“我好累”
   // 现在为一般现在时

   现在：
   汤姆：“杰克说他好累”
   // “杰克说他好累”。“杰克说”已经是5分钟前说的了。“累”是5分钟前的事了
   ```

   ```
   Five minutes ago:
   Jack: "I feel tired"
   // `I feel tired`为直接引语

   Now
   Tom: "Jack said he felt tired"
   // 因为杰克说的话和感到累都是5分钟前发生的事了
   // `Jack said`为主句。`he felt tired`为间接引语


   Five minutes ago:
   The book is interesting

   Now
   What did he say?

   He said that the book was interesting
   ```

   - 当主句为一般过去时，并且直接引语为现在进行时，那么间接引语就要变为过去进行时

   ```

   现在：

   ```

   - 当主句为一般过去时，并且直接引语为现在完成时/一般过去时，那么间接引语就要变为过去完成时
