```
I mustn't go to bed before twelve

I have to go to bed before twelve

I had to go to school yesterday

She has to stop her work, because she is very tired

He doesn't have to remain to stay the bed

I'm still on the way to work

Do you know the way to park?

I lost my way to work

I came to China three years ago
