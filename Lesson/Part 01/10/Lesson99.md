# Lesson 99

1. 在英语中常用`and`把两个动词连接在一起

   ```
   Try and stand up

   come upstairs and see it
   ```

2. `let me help you` 表示“让我来帮你”，其中`let`有“允许”的意思。后面要加不带`to`的动词不定式

3. 快速判断语句的时态

   ```
   Jack hurt himself
   // 首先看到`hurt`没有加`ed`没有加`ing`，也不能直接判断为一般现在时，因为单词的其它时态都为同一个
   // 判断没有`is`，`are`，直接pass掉现在进行时
   // 人称为第三人称但动词没加三单，直接pass掉一般现在时
   // `hurt`的过去式和自身一模一样，所以这个为一般过去时
   ```

4. 如果要把某人的话告诉另一个人，要用间接引语。间接引语不用加引号，往往在引语前加`that`等引导词

   ```
   The doctor says that he will come at once
   ```

5. 宾语从句

   - 定义：一个句子充当宾语，这个句子叫宾语从句

   ```
   我爱你
   // 根据“主谓宾”结构，“我”主语，“爱”谓语，“你”宾语

   我希望你有一些钱
   // “我”主语，“爱”谓语，“你有一些钱”为宾语从句，实际上就是把一个句子当成了宾语
   ```

   - 基本构成：`主语 + v. + （that） + 句子`

   - 括号中的 `that` 可以省略

   ```
   I hope that you've got some money
   // `I`主语，`hope`谓语，`that you've got some money`宾语从句

   I believe that this house is for sale

   I think that they'll move in the day after tomorrow

   I think they'll move in the day after tomorrow
   // `that` 可以不加

   Does he think he's hurt his back?
   ```

   - 经常组成宾语从句的动词：`think`，`believe`，`hope`，`say`，`understand`，`know`

   ```
   I think that you are right

   He believes that they will help him

   I hope that this food is safe here

   She says that she will help you

   We understand that we mustn't talk in the library

   I know that she likes apples
   ```

   - 当把含有宾语从句的句子变为疑问句时，要把宾语从句看成一个整体

   ```
   He says he'll write a letter soon
   // 把`he'll write a letter soon`看成一个整体，它不能拆分

   Does he say he'll write a letter soon?

   Why does he say he'll write a letter soon?

   What else does he say?

   He says he is staying at a Youth Hostel

   Is he says he staying at Youth Hostel?
   // 错误，不能这样问
   // 当变为一般疑问句时，只能用`does`去提问，不能用`is`，因为`is`是属于宾语从句的一部分

   Does he say he is staying at a Youth Hostel?

   Where does he say he's staying?
   ```

## Ow!

```
Ow!

What's the matter, Andy?

I slipped and fell downstairs

Have you hurt yourself?

Yes, I have. I think that I've hurt my back

Try and stand up. Can you stand up? Here. Let me help you

I'm sorry, Lucy. I'm afraid that I can't get up

I think that the doctor had better see you. I'll phone Dr. Carter

The doctor says that he will come at once. I'm sure that you need an X-ray, Andy
```
