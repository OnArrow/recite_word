# Lesson 129

1. `must` 表示推测

   - 基本公式：

     - `must have been adj./n.`

     - `must have done`

     - `must have been doing`

     - 以上的`have been`跟现在完成时没有关系，只是`must`的固定搭配

   - 表示推测，而且这个推测确信度高，对过去的肯定推测：当时一定是

   ```
   I must have been crazy
   我当时一定是疯了
   // `must have been adj./n.`

   He must have been tired
   他当时一定很累

   She must have eaten the apple
   她一定是吃苹果
   // `must have done`

   He must have seen the speed limit
   他当时一定看到限速牌了

   They must have been having a party
   他们当时一定是在举办一个派对
   // `must have been doing`

   Must they have been having a party?
   // 一般疑问句

   What must they have doing?
   // 特殊疑问句
   ```

2. `can't` 表示推测

   - 与`must`刚好相反，但表达的是“当时一定不是”

   ```
   I can't have been crazy
   我当时一定没疯

   He can't have been tired
   他当时一定不累

   She can't have eaten the apple
   她一定没吃苹果

   He can't have seen the speed limit
   他当时一定没看到限速牌

   They can't have been having a party
   他们当时一定没有在开派对
   ```

3. `wave to sb.` 朝某人招手

   ```
   She is waving to me
   ```

4. `away` 表示“距离...有多远”

   ```
   The railway station is 4 miles away
   火车站在4英里远的地方
   ```
