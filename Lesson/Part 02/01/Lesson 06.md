# Lesson 6

## Words

- beggar food pocket call

## Percy Buttons

```
I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street. Yesterday a beggar knocked at my door. He asked me for meal and a glass of beer.

In return for this, the beggar stood on his head and sang songs. I gave him a meal. He ate the food and drank the beer.

Then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away.

Later a neighbor told me about him. Everybody knows him. His name is Percy Buttons.

He calls at every house in the street once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer.
