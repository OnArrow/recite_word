What is your mother going to do?

She's going to wash these clothes

What is your mother doing?

She's washing these clothes

What is your father going to do?

He's going to paint that wall

What is your father doing?

He's painting that wall

What are they going to do?

They are going to do their homework

What are they doing?

They are doing their homework

What is that dog going to do?

It's going to eat its bones

What is that dog doing?

It's eating its bones

What is the child going to do?

He's going to play basketball

What is the child doing now?

Now he's playing basketball

What are you going to do?

I'm going to listen to music

What are you doing now?

I'm listening to the music
```

```
The dog is running after the cat

A man is going after these policemen

We're running after the horse

My parents are walking after a tiger

Tom's walking after me
```

```
We're running across the street

The ducks swimming across the river

Those cats are going across the bridge

These planes are flying across the city

The children are walking across the school
```

```
I'm sitting on the chair near a tree

That open shop is near the building

There are many flowers near the tree

How many knives are there near the electric cooker?

There are some villages near the valley
```

```
The dog is in the garden with a cat

I'm doing homework with Lisa

He's running in the grass with his family

The little boy is sleeping with his parents

A student sweeping the floor of the classroom with her teacher
```

```
The lamp is over the boy's head

There are many birds are flying over the tree

How many planes are there over the city?

Are there any bees flying over the flower?

There aren't any clouds over the building
