# Don't drop it

```
What are you going to do with that vase, Penny?

I'm going to put it on the table, Sam

Don't do that. Give it to me

What are you going to do with it?

I'm going to put it here, in front of the window

Be careful! Don't drop it!

Don't put it there, Sam. Put it here, on the shelf

There we are! It's a lovely vase

Those flowers are lovely, too
