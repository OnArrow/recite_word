1. `enjoy` 这个动词后面往往跟一个反身代词

   好好玩吧 / 祝你玩得开心

   enjoy ourselves
   玩得开心

   enjoy himself
   玩得开心
   ```

2. `get` “万金油”动词，需要结合上下文翻译

   ```
   get home
   回家

   get on
   上车

   get started
   开始
   // 开始做某事
   ```

## Not a baby

```
What are you going to do this evening, Jill?

I'm going to meet some friends, Dad

You mustn't come home late. You must be home at half past ten

I can't get home so early, Dad!

Can I have the key to the front door, please?

No, you can't

Jill's eighteen years old, Tom. She's not a baby. Give her the key. She always comes home early

Oh, all right!

Here you are. But you mustn't come home after a quarter past eleven. Do you hear?

Yes, Dad. Thanks, Mum

That's all right. Goodbye. Enjoy yourself!

We always enjoy ourselves, Mum. Bye-bye
