I'm swimming across the river

I'm walking across the street

He's running across the playground

They are going across the office

My family and I walking across the bridge
```

```
They are jumping off the wall

I'm going off the work

The office assistant is going off the office

My mother is going off the house

The bird is flying off the tree
```

```
I'm standing between the two men

He's sitting on the floor between the two chairs

The little girl is sleeping between her parents

That bird is flying between the two hills

They are walking between the two street
```

```
The park is beside a school

My house is beside a big tree

The playground is beside the school

The building is beside a hill

My grandmother's garden is beside the river
```

My wife and I are walking along the street

The cats are running along the wall

The children are running along the river

The bad dogs are running along a garden

The boy and the girl are dancing along the playground

I'm running into the station

These birds are flying into the garden

Those cats are jumping into the box

He's putting these trousers in the wardrobe

These bottles are in the box

Her new clothes are in the wardrobe

My students are cleaning the blackboard in this classroom

The children are playing basketball in the playground

This lunch on me

There are some apples on the tree

The boats are on the river

My son is sitting on the armchair

The boy is standing on the desk
```

```
My computer is near a pen on the desk

The boy is jumping near the door

The open shop is near the street

The beautiful flowers are near the river

The lion is going near a elephant
```

```
I'm swimming with my wife

The children are in the classroom with their teacher

Tom is reading a book under the tree with his family

My son is listening music with his friends

My mother is washing clothes with me
```

```
These boxes are under the big table

Those boats are going under the bridge

There aren't any dogs under the tree

I'm reading a book under the light

The man is sitting under a big open umbrella
```

```
The plane is flying over the bridge

The open light is over the bed

Those birds are flying over the building

These bees are flying over the flower

The big bridge is over my head
```

```
The dog is running after a cat

I'm walking after these women

The bee is flying after the bird

I'll do my homework after dinner

I'll sleep after lunch
