# Lesson 137

1. `if`的使用

   - `if...(一般现在时), 主语 + will do...(一般将来时)`

   - “主将现从”。意思是如果主句为一般将来时，那么条件从句要用一般现在时

   - `if`也可以放句子的后面

   - `if`开头的一般叫条件从句或者条件状语从句

   ```
   If you cook dinner, I will wash the dishes
   如果你做饭，我将会洗碗
   // `if you cook dinner`为条件从句

   I will wash the dishes if you cook dinner


   I will play football with you if my mother isn't at home


   If I have enough time tomorrow, I will come to see you
   // 尽管条件从句用了`tomorrow`，但还是得用一般现在时（have）

   Will you come to see me if you have enough time tomorrow?
   // 一般疑问句


   If it rains tomorrow, we will do nothing
   // 尽管出现了`tomorrow`，前面的`rain`还是得用一般现在时（rains）
   ```

2. `travel round the world` 环游世界

   ```
   We will travel round the world if we have a lot of money
   ```

3. `depend on sb./sth.` 依赖某人或某物

   ```
   The cat depend on me
   ```

## Words

```
football pool win world poor depend
```

## A pleasant dream

```
Are you doing the football pools, Brian?

Yes, I've nearly finished, Julie. I'm sure we'll win something this week

You always say that, but we never win anything! What will you do if you win a lot of money?

If I win a lot of money I'll buy you a mink coat

I don't want a mink coat! I want to see the world

All right. If we win a lot of money we'll travel round the world and we'll stay at the best hotels. Then we'll return home and buy a big house in the country. We'll have a beautiful garden and...

But if we spend all that money we'll be poor again. What'll we do then?

If we spend all the money we'll try and win the football pools again

It's a pleasant dream but everything depends on 'if'!
