Hello, Ken

Hi, George

Have you just been to the cinema?

Yes, I have

What's on?

'Paris in the Spring'

Oh, I've already seen it. I saw it on television last year. It's an old film, but it's very good

Paris is a beautiful city

I've never been there. Have you ever been there, Ken?

Yes, I have. I was there in April

Paris in the spring, eh?

It was spring, but the weather was awful. It rained all the time

Just like London!

## Whole

1. `go to a cinema` 去电影院

2. `see a film` 看电影

3. 如何表达 `任何时间都不要做`

   ```
   never ever

   Never ever take your eyes off the ball
   永远不要将你的眼睛从球上移开
   ```

4. 在电影院中看的电影一般叫 `film`，而 `movie` 通常指的是在哪里都能看的电影

5. `have gone to sw.` vs `have been to sw.`

   ```
   Jack went to Beijing last week

   Jack is in Beijing now

   Jack has gone to Beijing
   杰克去了北京
   // `have gone to` 表示`去了`，暗示杰克去了北京，但现在还没回来（对现在的影响）
   // 这一句相当于上面两句

   Jack went to Beijing last week

   Jack is in Nanning now

   Jack has been to Beijing
   // `have been to` 表示`去过`，暗示杰克去过北京，但现在已经离开了北京（对现在的影响）
   ```

   ```
   例句

   Jack isn't here at the moment, he's just gone to the shop to get a newspaper

   Jack has gone out, he'll be back in about an hour
   // `out` 在此为副词，所以不需要`to`

   Are you going to the bank?

   No, I've already been to the bank
   ```
