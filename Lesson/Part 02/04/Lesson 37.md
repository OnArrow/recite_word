## The Olympic Games

```
The Olympic Games will be held in our country in four years' time

As a great many people will be visiting the country, the government will be building new hotels, an immense stadium, and a new Olympic-standard swimming pool. They will also be building new roads and a special railway line.

The Games will be held just outside the capital and the whole area will be called 'Olympic City'.

Workers will have completed the new roads by the end of this year. By the end of next year, they will have finished work on the new stadium. The fantastic modern buildings have been designed by Kurt Gunter. Everybody will be watching anxiously as the new buildings go up.

We are all very excited and are looking forward to the Olympic Games because they have never been held before in this country.
