# Lesson 34

## Words

- station most

## Quick work

```
Dan Robinson has been worried all week. Last Tuesday he received a letter from the local police. In the letter he was asked to call at the station.

Dan wondered why he was wanted by the police, but he went to the station yesterday and now he is not worried anymore.

At the station, he was told by a smiling policeman that his bicycle had been found. Five days ago, the policeman told him, the bicycle was picked up in a small village four hundred miles away. It is now being sent to his home by train.

Dan was most surprised when he heard the news. He was amused too, because he never expected the bicycle to be found. It was stolen twenty years ago when Dan was a boy of fifteen!
```

## Whole

1. `Dan Robinson has been worried all week` 中的 `worried` 是属于 `adj.`。所以这句话不是 `被动语态`，而是 `现在完成时`

   - 绝大多数情况下看到 `have been done` 都可以翻译为 `被动语态`，但也有例外情况

   - 本文中的 `He was amused too` 也是例外情况，`amused` 为 `adj.`

2. `call at` 拜访。和 `visit` 类似

   ```
   He was asked to visit the station

   He was asked to call at the station
   // 和上一句一致


   I called at the shop yesterday morning
   我昨天早上路过了这个商店

   You must call at the police station as quickly as possible
   ```

3. `Dan wondered why he was wanted by the police`。 `被警察想要` 可以理解为 `被警察传唤`

4. `pick up` 最常见的表达是 `捡起某个东西`

5. `most` 当 `adv.` 使用时，和 `very` 一致

   ```
   She was very surprised when she heard the news

   She was most surprised when she heard the news
   // 和上一句一致
   ```

6. `expect sth. to be found` 期待某物被找到

   ```
   He expected his wallet to be found by the police

   She never expected her secret to be found by someone
   ```

7. `过去完成时被动语态`

   - 结构: `had been + done`

   ```
   The basket had been emptied

   The thieves had been caught

   The window had been broken
   ```
