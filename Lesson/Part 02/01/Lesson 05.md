```
Mr. James Scott has a garage in Silbury and now he has just bought another garage in Pinhurst.

Pinhurst is only five miles from Silbury, but Mr. Scott cannot get a telephone for his new garage. So he has just bought twelve pigeons.

Yesterday, a pigeon carried the first message from Pinhurst to Silbury. The bird covered the distance in three minutes.

Up to now, Mr. Scott has sent a great many requests for spare parts and other urgent messages from one garage to the other.

In this way, he has begun his own private 'telephone' service.
