## Sally's first train ride

```
Last week, my four-year-old daughter, Sally, was invited to a children's party

I decided to take her by train

Sally was very excited because she had never traveled on a train before

She sat near the window and asked questions about everything she saw. Suddenly, a middle-aged lady got on the train and sat opposite Sally

'Hello, little girl,' She said

Sally did not answer, but looked at her curiously

The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large, funny hat

After the train had left the station, the lady opened her handbag and took out her powder compact

She then began to make up her face

'Why are you doing that?' Sally asked

'To make myself beautiful,' the lady answered

She put away her compact and smiled kindly

'But you are still ugly,' Sally said

Sally was amused, but I was very embarrassed!

## Whole

1. 汉语里的 `主动` 和 `被动`

   - `主动`

   ```
   我扇了他一巴掌

   我喝了一瓶水

   他写完了作业
   ```

   - `被动`

   ```
   我 被 打了

   我 应邀 出席

   我 受到 老师的表扬

   我 遭到 父母的批评
   ```

   - 加上时态的 `被动`

   ```
   我昨天被打了

   我经常被打

   我刚挨揍

   明天我要挨打了
   ```

   - 汉语中的被动有时候不那么明显

   ```
   我在晒太阳
   // 实际上是我正在被太阳晒
   ```

2. M: `一般现在时的被动语态`

   - 被动语态结构：`be（表示时态） + done（表示被动）`

   - 根据被动语态结构，`be` 的一般现在时为 `am/is/are`，而 `done` 表示的是动词的过去分词

   - 因此，一般现在时的被动语态结构为：`am/is/are + done`

   ```
   Jack cleans the room everyday
   杰克每天都打扫房间
   // 这是主动语态。杰克是动作的发起者，房间是动作的承受者

   The room is cleaned everyday
   房间每天都被打扫
   // 被动语态。房间被谁打扫不重要，重要的是房间是动作的承受者
   // 根据结构，主语为`the room`，那么应该用`is`，`clean`应该变为过去分词`cleaned`

   The room is cleaned by Jack everyday
   房间每天都被杰克打扫
   // 给被动语态的句子添加更多信息

   Is the room cleaned everyday?
   房间每天都被打扫吗？
   // 一般疑问句

   Why is the room cleaned everyday?
   为什么房间每天都被打扫？
   // 特殊疑问句


   Someone sells stamps in the post office

   The stamps are sold in the post office


   They repair the car regularly

   The car is repaired regularly
   ```

3. M: `一般过去时的被动语态`

   - 结构：`was/were + done`

   ```
   Jack found his key last night
   杰克昨晚找到了他的钥匙

   Jack's key was found last night
   杰克的钥匙昨晚被找到了

   Was Jack's key found last night?
   杰克的钥匙昨晚找到了吗？
   // 一般疑问句

   Where was Jack's key found last night?
   杰克的钥匙昨晚在哪里找到的？
   // 特殊疑问句

   Someone stole my wallet yesterday

   My wallet was stolen yesterday
   ```

4. 不要一看到符合被动语态结构的句子就直接确定为被动语态，因为也有可能是其它。如本课中的一些例子

   ```
   Sally was very excited
   // 虽然有`was`有`excited`，看上去挺像一般过去时的被动语态，但实际上`excited`在这里表示的是`adj.`而不是`v.`，`very` 后面通常跟 `adj`，而不是 `v.`

   The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large, funny hat
   // 虽然有`was`和`dressed`，但是也不表示一般过去时的被动语态。在这里实际上是一个小短语`was dressed in`，表示的是 `穿着`
   ```

5. `wash powder` 洗衣粉

   ```
   The wash powder was used up by Tom
   ```

6. `make up her face` 化妆

   ```
   You needn't have made up your face
   ```

7. `get on` 登上

8. `middle aged` 中年的
