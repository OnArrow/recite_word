What are you going to do this evening, Jill?

I'm going to meet some friends, Dad

You mustn't come home late

You must be home at half past ten

I can't get home so early, Dad

Can I have the key to the front floor, please?

No, you can't

Jill's eighteen years old, Tom

She's not a baby, give her the key

She always comes home early

Oh, all right

Here you are, but you mustn't come home after a quarter past eleven. Do you hear?

Yes, Dad

Thanks, Mum

That's all right! Goodbye! Enjoy yourself

We always enjoy ourselves, Mum

Bye
