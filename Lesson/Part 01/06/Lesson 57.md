## Whole

1. 在英语中常用 `it` 来指 `时间`，`天气`，`温度`，`距离`。 这种情况下的 `it` 被称为 `虚主语`

   ```
   It's mild, but it rains sometimes
   // 这里指天气

   It's eight o'clock
   // 这里指时间

   It's very hot
   // 这里指温度

   It's very faraway from home
   // 这里指距离
   ```

2. `询问时间`

   ```
   It's 10 o'clock

   Is it 10 o'clock?

   What time is it?

   He drinks tea at 4 o'clock

   Does he drink tea at 4 o'clock?

   What time does he drink tea?

   What's the time?
   ```

3. `What time` 和 `When` 的区别

   ```
   When does he usually read a book?
   // `when` 通常表示问什么时候，可以回答大概的时间也可以回答具体的时间

   He usually reads a book in the evening

   What time does he usually read a book?
   // `what time` 通常表示问具体的几点钟

   He usually reads a book at 8 o'clock

   两者可以混用，没有严谨的区别，只是一个小的行为习惯
   ```

4. 表达 `几点几分`

   - 直接表达

   ```
   twelve fifty
   12:50

   nine fifteen
   9:15

   seven forty-eight
   7:48
   ```

   - 分钟 past 小时

   - 当分钟数 `大于30分`时不能用 `past`

   ```
   twenty nine past ten
   10:29

   half past 11
   11:30

   a quarter past 12
   12:15
   ```

   - 分 to 时

   - 差多少分钟到几点

   - `to` 用于分钟数 `大于30分` 的情况

   ```
   a quarter to 12
   11:45

   10 to 8
   7:50

   28 to 3
   2:32
   ```

5. `you all` 表示 `你们`。通常三个或三个以上才用

   ```
   What are you all doing?
   你们都在做什么？
   // “你们”最起码有三个人

   What do you all usually do at night?
   你们晚上通常做什么？

   You all can't go to swim
   ```
