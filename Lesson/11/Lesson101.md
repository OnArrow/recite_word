# Lesson 101

1. `speak up` 大声地说

   ```
   Speak up, I can't hear you
   ```

2. `write to sb.` 写信给某人

   ```
   Can you write to my mother tomorrow?

   Don't write to me! I don't want to know at all

   You haven't written to me for a long time

   I'm gonna write you a letter soon
   ```

3. 只要是`v. to sb.`的形式，都可以互相转换

   ```
   Give a glass of water to me

   Give me a glass of water

   Write to you
   // `write`本身就有写信的意思

   Write you a letter

   Buy some flowers to me

   Buy me some flowers
   ```

4. 直接引语

   - 中文里是把其他人说的话加上引号

   ```
   杰克说：“我们今天吃什么呢？”
   // 引号中的就是直接引语
   ```

   ```
   The doctor says, 'I will come at once'
   // 引号中的为直接引语

   'I have just arrived in China' says Jack

   He says, 'I feel tired'
   ```

5. 间接引语

   - 把其他人说的话调整一下人称复述一遍

   - 间接引语就是一个宾语从句

   ```
   杰克说他今天没吃饭
   // “他今天没吃饭”就是间接引语
   ```

   ```
   The doctor says that he will come at once
   // `that he will come at once`为间接引语
   // 这里的间接引语同时又是宾语从句，所以`that`也可以去掉

   Jack says he has just arrived in China

   He says he feels tired
   ```

6. 直接引语改为间接引语总结

   - 引号去掉

   - 转换人称

   - 添加引导词`that`（也可以不添加）

7. 反意疑问句

   - 理解：用相反的话来确认自己的判断，获取真实的信息

   ```
   他今天没吃午饭，不是吗？
   // “不是吗”就是反意疑问句，和前一句表达的意思相反
   // 用“不是吗？”来确认前一句“他今天没吃午饭”

   今天周六，所以不用上班，对吧？

   杰克很牛逼，不是吗？
   ```

   ```
   Jack is in China, isn't he?

   Penny goes to school on foot every day, doesn't she?

   You met Jack last night, didn't you?

   The bird can't swim, can it?

   He hasn't finished his work, has he?
   他没完成他的工作，不是吗？
   ```

   ```
   Example:

   These aren't your books, are they?

   She has never been to China, has she?
   ```

   - 可以用`right`来替代后面的反意疑问句

   ```
   Jack is in China, right?

   Penny goes to school on foot every day, right?

   He hasn't finished his work, right?
   ```

   - 总结

     - 前肯后否，前否后肯。 前一句用肯定句时，后一句要用否定句，反之亦然

     - 前后人称、时态、情态动词等都要保持一致
