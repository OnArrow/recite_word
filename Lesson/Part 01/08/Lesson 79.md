```
What are you doing, Carol?

I'm making a shopping list, Tom

What do we need?

We need a lot of things this week

I must go to the grocer's. We haven't got much tea or coffee, and we haven't got any sugar or jam

What about vegetables?

I must go to the greengrocer's. We haven't got many tomatoes, but we've got a lot of potatoes

I must go to the butcher's, too. We need some meat. We haven't got any meat at all

Have we got any beer and wine?

No, we haven't. And I'm not going to get any!

I hope that you've got some money

I haven't got much

Well, I haven't got much either!
```

## Whole

1. `make a shopping list`、`write a shopping list` 制作一张购物清单

   ```
   Did you make a shopping list?

   No, I didn't. I'm going to make it

   Did you write a shopping list?

   No, I didn't. I'm going to write it
   ```

2. `a lot of` 许多的。既可用于 `可数名词` 又可用于 `不可数名词`，可用于 `肯定句，否定句，疑问句`

   ```
   We need a lot of money

   There are a lot of birds in the tree

   He wants a lot of water
   ```

3. `at all` 一般用于 `否定句`，表示 `丝毫；根本；一点` 的意思，有强调作用。`not...at all` 一点也没有

   ```
   We haven't got any meat at all
   我们丝毫没有一点肉了

   I haven't got any money at all
   我一点钱都没有了

   He hasn't got any water at all
   他根本一点水都没有了
   ```

4. `many` 和 `much` 都表示 `许多`。`many` 和 `much` 都用于 `疑问句` 和 `否定句` 中，但 `many` 配合 `可数名词` 使用，`much` 配合 `不可数名词` 使用

   ```
   We haven't got many tomatoes

   Have we got many tomatoes?

   He hasn't got much wine

   Has he got much wine?
   ```

5. `have got`

   - 和单独用 `have` 表达的意思相同。`have got` 可以合起来当成一个单词来翻译，直接翻译为 `有`

     ```
     I have a car
     我有一辆车

     I have got a car
     我有一辆车

     He has a cup of coffee

     He has got a cup of coffee

     He's got a cup of coffee
     // `has got` 三单时可以缩写，但必须要 `has got` 一起的时候才能缩写
     ```

   - 句型

     1. `have got`（肯定句）结构：`主语 + have got + 其它`

        ```
        I have got a new phone

        He has got a pair of shoes

        They have got two glasses
        ```

     2. `have got`（否定句）结构：`主语 + have + not + got + 其它`

        ```
        Tips:

        I don't have a new phone
        // 这个是一般时，和`have got`不一样
        ```

        ```
        I have not got a new phone

        He hasn't got a pair of shoes

        They haven't got two glasses
        ```

     3. `have got`（疑问句）结构：`Have（提到句首）+ 主语 + got + 其它`

        ```
        Have you got a new phone?

        Has he got a pair of shoes?

        Have they got two glasses?
        ```
