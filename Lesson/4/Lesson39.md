# Lesson 39

1. `Don't` 为 `Do not` 的缩写，可以理解为“别；不要”

   ```
   Don't drop it

   Don't cry

   Don't sleep in class

   Don't eat on the bus

   Don't jump on the desk

   I Don't remember
   ```

2. `give sb. sth.` = `give sth. to sb.`

   ```
   Give me some flower

   Give some flower to me
   ```

3. `There we are` 表示“好了；就这样；okay”的意思

4. 名句

   ```
   I'm careful not to confuse excellence with perfection. Excellence I can reach for, perfection is God's business
   我很小心，不要把卓越和完美混为一谈。我可以追求卓越，完美是上帝的职责
   ```

## Don't drop it

```
What are you going to do with that vase, Penny?

I'm going to put it on the table, Sam

Don't do that. Give it to me

What are you going to do with it?

I'm going to put it here, in front of the window

Be careful! Don't drop it!

Don't put it there, Sam. Put it here, on the shelf

There we are! It's a lovely vase

Those flowers are lovely, too
