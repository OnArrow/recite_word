Can you come here a minute please, Bob?

Yes, sir?

Where's Pamela?

She's next door. She's in her office, sir

Can she type this letter for me? Ask her, please

Yes, sir

Can you type this letter for the boss please, Pamela?

Yes, of course I can

Here you are

Thank you, Bob

Bob!

Yes? What's the matter?

I can't type this letter

I can't read it. The boss's handwriting is terrible!
