What are you going to do with the pencil?

I'm going to drop it into the basket

Give me that cat

Give the cat to me

Send the letter to me

Send me letter

What are you going to do with those flowers?

I'm going to give them to my mother

What are you going to do with the newspaper in your hands?

I'm going to take them to my father

What are you going to do with the fruit in the basket?

I'm going to give them to my friends

Who is the fruit in the basket for?

They are for my friends

My mother is washing dishes for me

What are you doing now?

I'm sleeping

What are you going to do with these pictures?

I'm going to show them to my student

What's he going to do with the toys?

He's going to give some of them to his friends

Don't put your phone on the desk

Don't put on the clothes

Don't drink milk before lunch

Don't drop it there

Don't forget me

Don't jump in the bed

Are you going to the bathroom?

No, I'm not, I'm going to my bedroom
