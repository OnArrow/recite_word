# Lesson 63

1. `yet` 一般用于否定句和疑问句，通常出现在句尾

   ```
   You mustn't get up yet
   你还不能起床

   You can't eat yet
   你还不能吃饭

   I mustn't sleep yet
   我还不能睡觉

   Have you had lunch yet?

   Has Penny arrived home yet?
   ```

2. `mustn't` 不表示"不必须,不必",不能简单地通过`must`来对应翻译`mustn't`. `mustn't`应该理解为"禁止"，严重语气

   ```
   You mustn't go!
   你不能走!

   He mustn't make a noise in the library!
   他不能在图书馆发出噪音!

   You mustn't smoke here!
   你不能在这里抽烟!

   Don't smoke here
   不要在这里抽烟
   // `don't` 的语气比 `mustn't` 柔和一点
   ```

3. 和某人玩 `play with sb.`

   ```
   I'm playing with Jack

   We are going to swim with Tom next week

   He wants to play with Penny
   ```

4. 和某人说话，交谈 `talk to sb.`

   ```
   I'm talking to Jack

   Who are you talking?

   Does he want to talk to me?
   ```
