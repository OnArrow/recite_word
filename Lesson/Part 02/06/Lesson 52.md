## A pretty carpet

```
We have just moved into a new house and I have been working hard all morning.

I have been trying to get my new room in order. This has not been easy because I own over a thousand books.

To make matters worse, the room is rather small, so I have temporarily put my books on the floor.

At the moment, they cover every inch of floor space and I actually have to walk on them to get in or out of the room.

A short while ago, my sister helped me to carry one of my old bookcases up the stairs.

She went into my room and got a big surprise when she saw all those books on the floor. 'This is the prettiest carpet I have ever seen.' she said.

She gazed at it for some time then added, 'You don't need bookcases at all. You can sit here in your spare time and read the carpet!'

## Questions

1. `have been working hard all morning` 什么时态？现在完成进行时？

2. `got a big surprise` 被吓了一大跳

## Whole

1. `every inch of sth.` 某物的每一寸地方

   ```
   The doctor examined every inch of his body.

   Every inch of ground was shone by the sun.
   ```

2. `现在完成进行时`

   - 强调动作本身，至于动作完成是否不重要

   - 用法一: 过去一直进行的动作（这个动作结束了），对现在造成影响

   - 结构： `主语 + have/has been doing sth.`

   ```
   Jack is very tired. He has been working very hard.
   // 因为在过去的一段时间里Jack非常努力地工作，所以才导致现在的 `Jack is very hard`


   Jack: Your eyes look red, what happened?

   Mary: I have been watching TV.
   // 过去的一段时间里一直在看电视，所以才导致的眼睛看起来很红


   Jack: You're out of breath, have you been running?

   Mary: Yes, I've been running.
   // 之前一直在跑步以至于现在上气不接下气


   Jack: Your hands are dirty, what have you been doing?

   Mary: I've been cleaning the room.
   ```

   - 用法二: 过去一直进行的动作持续到现在，这个动作也许还会继续

     ```
     It is raining now, it began raining two hours ago and it is still raining.

     Jack: How long has it been raining?

     Mary: It has been raining for two hour.
     // 下雨这个动作已经从过去持续2小时到现在了，可能还会继续下


     He has tried to get his room in order all morning.

     Yes, he's been trying to get his room in order all morning and he's still trying.
     // 整理房间这个动作从过去持续到现在，并且这个动作还在继续
     ```

   - `have been doing` & `have done`

     ```
     She has been painting her bedroom.
     // 只是在强调粉刷房间这个动作，至于这个动作是否已经完成不重要

     She has painted her bedroom.

3. `get sth. in order` 把某物整理好

4. `to make matters worse...` 使事情变得更糟糕的是...

   To make matters worse, he's left his phone in the room.

   To make matters worse, she doesn't want to be on a diet at all.
   ```
