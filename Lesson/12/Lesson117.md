# Lesson 117

1. 过去进行时：`was/were + doing`

   - 一个动作在过去的时间里正在进行

   ```
   I was doing my homework at 8 o'clock last night
   昨晚8点的时候，我当时正在做我的作业

   I wasn't doing my homework at 8 o'clock last night

   Were you doing your homework at 8 o'clock last night?

   We were swimming in the river at 4 p.m. yesterday
   昨天下午4点的时候我们当时在游泳
   // 我们当时在游泳，昨天下午4点的时候。可以把`was/were + doing`理解为“当时在做某事”

   Were you swimming in the river at 4 p.m. yesterday?

   What were you doing at 4 p.m. yesterday?
   昨天下午4点的时候你们当时在干嘛？

   Where were you swimming at 4 p.m. yesterday?
   ```

2. 时间状语从句（时间从句）

   - 定义：句子做时间状语

   - 可以理解为用一句话来交代清楚时间，而不是用一个词或短语。这句话就叫时间状语从句或者时间从句

   ```
   He was cooking a meal at 10 o'clock
   // 这里的`at 10 o'clock`为一个时间短语

   He was cooking a meal when his son was listening to the music
   当他的儿子在听音乐的时候他在做饭
   // `when his son was listening to the music` 为时间状语从句。这句话已经交代清楚了时间
   // `when`引导了后面整句话，交代了`cooking`这个动作发生的时间
   ```

   - 时间状语从句可以放在主句的前面，也可以放在主句的后面

   ```
   It rained heavily when I was driving to London

   When I was driving to London, it rained heavily
   ```

3. `when` & `while`

   - 表达的意思都一样；“当...的时候”

   - `when` 通常为 `when + was doing/did`

   - `when` 可以跟过去进行时和一般过去时连用

   - `while` 通常为 `while + was doing`

   - `while` 通常只和过去进行时连用

   ```
   Someone knock at the door when I was having lunch
   当我在吃饭的时候有人在敲门
   // 什么时候敲的门？当“我”在吃饭的时间。交代了敲门这个动作发生的时间

   She was washing the dished when the telephone rang

   She was cooking the dinner when I knocked at the door
   ```

   ```
   She was cooking the dinner while I was watching TV
   当我在看电视的时候，她在做晚饭

   I was playing games while my father was sleeping last night

   She was drinking wine while we were drinking tea
   ```

4. `see you later alligator` 是比较俏皮的一种表达，有点类似于“拜拜了您嘞，回头见”。但核心还是表示“回头见”。

5. `boil over` 某个东西煮沸了然后溢出来了

   ```
   The tea boiled over
   茶煮沸溢出来了
   ```
