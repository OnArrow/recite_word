# Lesson 107

## Words

- madam smart suit pretty

## Whole

1. `as well` 同样

2. 形容词的比较级&最高级

   - 中文里，通常用“好，更好，最好”来表示比较级和最高级

   ```
   幕刃适合剑魔

   咳血比幕刃更适合剑魔

   无尽之刃最适合剑魔
   ```

3. 比较级和最高级的构成

   - 单音节形容词在后面加`er`构成比较级。加`est`构成最高级

   ```
   small
   smaller
   smallest

   new
   newer
   newest

   old
   older
   oldest
   ```

   - 以`e`结尾的直接加`r`构成比较级。加`st`构成最高级

   ```
   large
   larger
   largest

   nice
   nicer
   nicest
   ```

   - 以辅音字母加`y`结尾的，把`y`替换成`i`，再加`er/est`

   ```
   pretty
   prettier
   prettiest

   easy
   easier
   easiest

   heavy
   heavier
   heaviest
   ```

   - `辅 + 元 + 辅`，双写末尾辅音字母，再加`er/est`

   ```
   big
   bigger
   biggest

   hot
   hotter
   hottest

   fat
   fatter
   fattest
   ```

4. 比较级一般用法

   ```
   She's got a larger dress
   ```

5. 比较级用法（than）

   - 规则：`主语 + be + adj.er + than + 比较对象`

   ```
   You are prettier than her
   你比她漂亮

   The left dog is smaller than the right dog

   The right dog is bigger than the left dog
   ```

6. 最高级用法

   - 规则（1）：`主语 + be + the + adj.est + （n.） + 范围`

   - `the`可以理解为“特指”，因为已经是“最好，最厉害，最漂亮”了

   - “范围”可以理解为在某个群体或某个地区里面“最好，最厉害，最漂亮”

   - 当主语重复时，`n.` 可以去掉

   ```
   My father is the coolest man in the world
   我爸爸是世界上最酷的男人

   My mother is the prettiest person in the world

   You are the tallest in this class
   ```

   - 规则（2）：`主语 + be + the + adj.est + I've ever met/seen/known`

   - 最后的`I've ever met/seen/known`也可以理解为一个范围，“我”所见到过的所有人这个范围里面，“我”所认识的所有人这个范围里面

   ```
   This is the craziest thing I've ever done
   这是我做过的最疯狂的事

   The girl is the prettiest I have ever met

   The students are the cleverest he's ever taught
   ```

7. `as well` 相当于 `too`

   ```
   The dress is very smart

   Yes, the coat is very pretty, as well
   是的，这件外套也很漂亮
   ```

8. `suit yourself` 随你便/随便你/都行

   ```
   Can I go out to play?

   Suit yourself
   ```

9. `would like + sth.` 可以理解为 `want sth.`，但语气比较委婉，`would like`不要分开翻译，把它当成一个词

   ```
   I want some tea

   I would like some tea

   I would like to help you

   I'd like some tea
   // 当主语后面为`would like`时可以进行缩写

   Would you like some tea?
   你想要喝点茶吗？
   // 变一般疑问句时`would`提到句首

   Yes, I would

   No, I wouldn't
   ```

10. `which` 也可以对形容词提问，表示“哪一些/哪一个”

    ```
    Short skirts are in fashion now

    Which skirts are in fashion now?
    ```

## Words

```
madam smart suit pretty
```

## It's too small

```
Do you like this dress, madam?

I like the color very much. It's a lovely dress, but it's too small for me

What about this one? It's a lovely dress. It's very smart. Short skirts are in fashion now. Would you like to try it?

All right

I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well. It's smaller than the blue one

I don't like the color either. It doesn't suit me at all. I think the blue dress is prettier

Could you show me another blue dress? I want a dress like that one, but it must be my size

I'm afraid I haven't got a large dress. This is the largest dress in the shop
```
