# Lesson 67

1. 表示某一种商店的短语中，往往可以把`shop`这个词省略

   ```
   The butcher's shop
   肉店

   The butcher's
   肉店
   // `shop`可以省略掉

   I'm gonna the butcher's

   The grocer's shop

   The grocer's

   The hairdresser's shop

   The hairdresser's
   ```

2. 问候对方身体如何时，也可以用`How are you all keeping?`

   ```
   How are you all keeping?

   I'm very well

   How are you?

   I'm fine, thanks
   ```

3. `for the weekend` 指整个周末的全部时间，而`at the weekend`则强调时间的某一点

   ```
   I'm going to stay at home for the weekend
   我准备整个周末都待在家里
   // 指的是周末的全部时间

   I'm going to stay at home at the weekend
   我打算周末待在家里
   // 并不是指周末的全部时间都待在家里，而是某个时候而已
   ```

4. `Aren't you lucky!` 这句话是否定疑问句形式的感叹句，目的是加强语气。尽管形式上是否定的，但却表示强有力的肯定

   ```
   I get two hundred every day

   Aren't you lucky!

   He drives all day

   Isn't he lucky!

   Can't you see me?
   难道你看不到我吗?

   Isn't he Jack?
   难道他不是杰克吗？

   Aren't you going to help him?
   难道你打算帮他吗？
   ```

5. `was` 在用于一些价格时，可以表达出“之前；过去”的意思。`was`是过去的价格，`now`是现在的价格
