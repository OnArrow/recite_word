## A blessing in disguise?

```
The tiny village of Frinley is said to possess a 'cursed tree'. Because the tree was mentioned in a newspaper, the number of visitors to Frinley has now increased.

The tree was planted near the church fifty years ago, but it is only in recent years that it has gained an evil reputation.

It is said that if anyone touches the tree, he will have bad luck; if he picks a leaf, he will die. Many villagers believe that the tree has already claimed a number of victims.

The vicar has been asked to have the tree cut down, but so far he has refused.

He has pointed out that the tree is a useful source of income, as tourists have been coming from all parts of the country to see it.

In spite of all that has been said, the tourists have been picking leaves and cutting their names on the tree - trunk. So far, not one of them has been struck down by sudden death!

10. M: `强调句`

    - 着重强调某个人/东西，加强语气

      ```
      那个新手机是我在她生日的时候送给她的。
      // 中文的强调句要靠说话的语气来表达。不是别的日子，就是在她生日的日子里送给她的
      ```

    - 强调人/东西。句型: `it is/was + 强调部分 + that/who + 剩余部分`

      ```
      My secretary sent the bill to Jack yesterday.
      // 没有强调什么，只是平铺直叙地表达

      It was the bill that my secretary sent to Jack yesterday.
      昨天我的秘书把这张账单发给了Jack
      // 强调 `这张账单`，而不是别的什么东西
      // `the bill` 就是强调部分，剩余的句子照抄就好了

      It was my secretary that sent the bill to Jack yesterday.
      // 强调的 `是我的秘书` 而不是别人，把这张账单发给Jack

      It was Jack who my secretary sent the bill to yesterday.
      // 强调 `发给了Jack`，而不是把账单发给别的什么人
      // 如果强调的是人，那么也可以使用 `who`，但 `that` 是万能的，所以还是推荐用 `that`

      It was yesterday that my secretary sent the bill to Jack.
      // 强调的是 `昨天发的账单`，而不是前天，明天

      My secretary did send the bill to Jack yesterday.
      我的秘书真的把这张账单发给Jack了
      // 如果是强调


      It has gained an evil reputation only in recent years.

      It is it that has gained an evil reputation only in recent years.
      // 错误。不能用 `it is it`，这个 `it` 必须变成具体的东西

      It is the tree that has gained an evil reputation only in recent years.
      // 正确。`it` 指代 `the tree`
      ```

    - 强调动作。在动词前面根据时态加上 `do`,`does`,`did`

      ```
      My secretary sent the bill to Jack yesterday.
      // 没有强调什么，只是平铺直叙地表达

      My secretary did sent the bill to Jack yesterday.
      我的秘书真的把这张账单发给Jack了
      // 强调 `发送`，真的发送了，这个动作真的已经做了
      // 一句话中只能有一个时态。因为有 `did`，所以 `sent` 需要换回原形

      I do like tea.
