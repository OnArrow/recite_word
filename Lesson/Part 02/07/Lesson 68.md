## Persistent

```
I crossed the street to avoid meeting him, but he saw me and came running towards me. It was no use pretending that I had not seen him, so I waved to him.

I never enjoy meeting Nigel Dykees. He never has anything to do. No matter how busy you are, he always insists on coming with you.

I had to think of a way of preventing him from following me around all morning.

'Hello, Nigel,' I said. 'Fancy meeting you here!'

'Hi, Elizabeth,' Nigel answered. 'I was just wondering how to spend the morning - until I saw you. You're not busy doing anything, are you?'

'No, not at all,' I answered. 'I'm going to...'

'Would you mind my coming with you?' he asked, before I had finished speaking.

'Not at all,' I lied, 'but I'm going to the dentist.'

'Then I'll come with you,' he answered. 'There's always plenty to read in the waiting room!'
