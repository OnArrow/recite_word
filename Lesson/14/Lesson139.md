# Lesson 139

1. 一般疑问句做宾语从句

   - 一般疑问句做宾语从句时，一般疑问句的要先变为陈述语序，同时使用`if`引导，这个`if`不翻译为“如果”，翻译为“是否”

   - `if` 不能省略

   - 像疑问句用`any`，肯定句用`some`这些规则，在这里都不需要变，`any`还是用`any`，`some`还是用`some`

   ```
   Is she a nurse?
   // 一般疑问句

   She is a nurse
   // 变为陈述语序

   I want to know if she is a nurse
   我想知道她是否是一个护士
   // `if she is a nurse`为宾语从句

   Do you want to know if she is a nurse?
   // 主句为`I want to know`，而`if she is a nurse`为宾语从句。所以一定要用主句来变为一般疑问句

   Why do you want to know if she is a nurse?
   ```

   ```
   Do you want an apple?

   I want to know if you want an apple


   Is he ill?

   I want to know if he is ill


   Does she often go shopping?

   I want to know if she often goes shopping


   Did Tom go to bed early?

   She wants to know if Tom went to bed early
   // 宾语从句也需要遵循时态，所以这里需要变为`went`


   Are there any mistakes in my paper?

   He wants to know if there are any mistakes in his paper
   // 疑问句用的`any`，变为宾语从句时还是用`any`
   ```

2. 特殊疑问句做宾语从句

   - 特殊疑问句做宾语从句时，除了特殊疑问词（What、Who、Which、Where），剩下的需要变为陈述语序，同时用这个特殊疑问词引导

   ```
   Who is she?
   // 特殊疑问句

   Who she is
   // 除了特殊疑问词，其它的需要变为陈述语序

   I want to know who she is
   我想知道她是谁
   // 因为特殊疑问句的特殊疑问词为`who`，所以`who she is`是一个`who`引导的宾语从句
   ```

   ```
   What are you talking about?

   I want to know what you are talking about

   I don't know what you are talking about


   Where are you from?

   I want to know where you are from?


   What's your job?

   I want to know what your job is
   // 注意这里`your job`是主语而不能是`your is job`


   When does Tom arrive?

   He wants to know when Tom arrives
   // 注意`arrive`是需要变三单的，因为宾语从句也是一个句子，也要遵循时态
   ```

3. `by the way` 顺便说一句
