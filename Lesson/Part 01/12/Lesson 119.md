## A true story

```
Do you like stories?

I want to tell you a true story

It happened to a friend of mine a year ago

While my friend, George, was reading in bed, two thieves climbed into his kitchen

After they had entered the house, they went into the dining room

It was very dark, so they turned on a torch

Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them

'What's up? What's up?' someone called

The thieves dropped the torch and ran away as quickly as they could

George heard the noise and came downstairs quickly

He turned on the light, but he couldn't see anyone

The thieves had already gone

But George's parrot, Henry, was still there

'What's up, George?' he called

'Nothing, Henry,' George said and smiled

'Go back to sleep'
```

## Whole

1. `过去完成时`

   - 含义：强调过去某一动作发生在另一动作或状态之前（过去的过去）

   - 结构：和现在完成时一样需要 `have done`，只不过过去完成时需要把 `have` 变为 `had`。所以过去完成时为 `had done`

   - 经常与 `after`，`before` 连用

   ```
   昨晚看完电视后，我就去吃晚饭了
   // 先看完的电视，之后才去吃晚饭。看完电视是过去完成时（过去的过去），而去吃晚饭是一般过去时（过去）

   我把旧车卖了，然后买了一辆新的
   // 先卖旧车（过去的过去），之后才买新车（过去）

   小明骂了杰克，杰克扇了小明一巴掌
   // 先骂（过去的过去）后扇巴掌（过去）

   吃饭前先洗手
   // 洗手（过去的过去），吃饭（过去）
   ```

   ```
   I went to have dinner after I had watched television
   // `went to have dinner` 为一般过去时，而`had watched television`为过去完成时

   After I had watched television, I went to have dinner
   // 和上一句意思相同



   I bought a new car after I had sold the old car

   After I had sold the old car, I bought a new car




   I said thanks after he had given me the letter

   I had given him the letter before he said thanks



   They had washed their hands before they had dinner

   Before they had dinner, they had washed their hands



   I had already run far away before you knew it

   Before you knew it, I had already run far away
   ```

2. `tell a story` 讲一个故事

   ```
   If I wanted, I would tell you a true story

   You needn't have told the boring story to me
   ```

3. `shit happens` 当你遇到什么不好的事情的时候安慰自己 `屋漏偏逢连夜雨`，`谁也不会是一帆风顺的` 的那种情感

4. `as quickly as they could` 他们尽可能快地...

   ```
   They ran away as quickly as they could

   I'm doing my homework as quick as I can

   He's finishing the work as quickly as he can by 3 p.m.
   ```
