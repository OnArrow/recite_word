# Must be & can't be

## 含义

### must be

1. `must`有两个含义，一个表示“必须”，另一个表示“推测”

2. 表示“推测”时，分为对现在的肯定推测（译为：“一定是”）和对过去的肯定推测（译为：“当时一定是”）

3. 这个推测肯定推测，并且确信度高

#### 对现在的肯定推测

1. **基本公式**

   - `must be adj./n.` 一定是...

   - `must be doing` 现在一定是在做某事

2. **Examples**

   ```
   街上那个挎着LV包的女人一定很有钱
   // LV包很贵，一般人买不起，所以我基于现在所获得的信息进行肯定的推测：“她一定很有钱”

   这杯水是我的
   // 肯定句，没有推测

   这杯水一定是我的
   // 推测句。很大概率是我的
   ```

   ```
   The glass of water is mine
   // 肯定句

   The glass of water must be mine
   // 推测句

   She is rich

   She must be rich

   They have a lot of money

   They must have a lot of money

   He is walking in the park

   He must be walking in the park
   ```

#### 对过去的肯定推测

1. **基本公式**

   - `must have done` 当时一定做了（完成了）某事
