# Lesson 61

1. `What's the matter with ...` 常用来询问人或事物的状况

   ```
   What's the matter with him?
   他怎么了？

   What's the matter with your son?

   What's the matter with the dog?
   ```

2. `must` 在语法结构上比较像 `can`。`must` 后面跟的也是动词原形

   ```
   We must call a doctor

   Must we call a doctor?

   Yes, we must

   What must he do?

   He must go to hospital
   ```

   ```
   We can call a doctor

   Can we call a doctor?

   Yes, we can

   What can he do?

   He can go to hospital
   ```

3. 一般来说动词后面都加名词，但是感官动词后面可以加形容词

   - 感官动词：feel sound smell taste look

     ```
     I feel ill

     It sounds terrible

     It smells great

     The apple tastes nice

     He looks tired
     ```
