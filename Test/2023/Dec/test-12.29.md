You can take a seat

The seat is taken

Is the seat taken?

Who is the seat taken by?

I get very angry

Do you get very angry?

Does he get very angry?

Who gets very angry?

Don't turn round

I turned round immediately, saw a cat was sitting on the window

You will turn round for that gift

How will you do for that gift?

How can you bear it?

He always goes to the theatre

He went to the theatre yesterday

He went to the theatre after he had had a bath

He was going to the theatre at three p.m yesterday

He will go to the theatre tomorrow morning

He's going to go to the theatre next Saturday

He hadn't ever been to the theatre

He had gone to the theatre last week

He's going to the theatre by car

He was hit by a stone in the theatre the day before yesterday

He has to go to the theatre, because his mother is angry

He'd better go to the theatre tomorrow

Can you tell me if he went to the theatre yesterday?

What will you do if he goes to the theatre?

Can you tell me where the biggest theatre is?

The biggest theatre is at the centre of the city

Jack said he is in the theatre

Jack said he had gone to the theatre

There is none in the theatre

There are no people in the theatre

There aren't any people in the theatre

The theatre must be the biggest

The theatre can't be the smallest

The theatre must be the most big

The theatre can't be the most small

I hadn't ever been to the theatre

Neither am I

I had been to the theatre which in Paris last year

So is he

To tell you the truth, I don't like to go to the theatre

What are there in the theatre?

I will take you to go the theatre if I've got a car

He must have been to the theatre yesterday

There must have been many people in the theatre yesterday

He may have been to the theatre yesterday

He may be to the theatre now

He may not be the theatre now

He may not have been to the theatre yesterday

What a big theatre!

I want to go to the theatre which is the biggest

The theatre which is building will be the biggest in the world

He couldn't drive to the theatre yesterday

Would you like take a seat in the theatre?

The seat in the centre of the theatre is taken by someone
