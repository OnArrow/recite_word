# Lesson 83

1. `make a mess` 表示“制造混乱”

   ```
   Don't make a mess in the room
   不要把房间搞得乱七八糟
   ```

2. 如果希望别人做出肯定的回答而不是单纯表示客套的时候，疑问句可以用`some`

   ```
   Do you want to have some beef?
   // 这里是真心希望对面做出肯定的回答，所以可以用`some`

   Yes, I do
   ```

## Going on holiday

```
Hello, Sam. Come in

Hi, Sam. We're having lunch. Do you want to have lunch with us?

No, thank you, Tom. I've already had lunch. I had lunch at half past twelve

Have a cup of coffee then

I've just had a cup, thank you. I had one after my lunch

Let's go into the living room, Carol. We can have our coffee there

Excuse the mess, Sam. This room's very untidy. We're packing our suitcases. We're going to leave tomorrow. Tom and I are going to have a holiday

Aren't you lucky!

When are you going to have a holiday, Sam?

I don't know. I've already had my holiday this year

Where did you go?

I stayed at home!
