# Lesson 113

## Words

```
conductor fare change note passenger none neither tramp except
```

## Small change

```
Fares, please!

Trafalgar Square, please

I'm sorry, sir. I can't change a ten-pound note

Haven't you got any small change?

I've got no small change, I'm afraid

I'll ask some of the passengers

Have you any small change, sir?

I'm sorry. I've got none

I haven't got any either

Can you change this ten-pound note, madam?

I'm afraid I can't

Neither can I

I'm very sorry, sir. You must get off the bus. None of our passengers can change this note. They're all millionaires!

Except us

I've got some small change

So have I
```

## Whole

1. `not` & `no`

   - `not...any/a n.` = `no + n.`

   ```
   I did not see any cars in the street

   I saw no cars in the street
   // 两个句子表达的意思相同
   // `not...any`表示否定，用`no`替代。同时`did`一般不出现在肯定句中，所以`did`可以省略
   // 时态上，因为`did`是过去式，所以动词`see`也要变成过去式

   I haven't got any time

   I have got no time

   There aren't any books on the shelves

   There are no books on the shelves
   ```

   - 同时这也适用于不定代词

   ```
   Did you go anywhere yesterday?

   No, I didn't go anywhere
   // 这里同样的出现了`not...any`，只不过`any`是和`where`连在一起的。不过也不影响转化为`no`

   No, I went nowhere
   // 这里的`no`是由`not...any`转化过来的
   ```

2. `no` & `none`

   - `no + n.` = `none`

   ```
   Have you got any beer?

   We have not got any beer

   We have got no beer
   // 先变为`no`的形式

   We have got none
   我们没有
   // `no beer` 变为了 `none`
   // `none`在用的时候要根据上下文来赋予`none`表示的是什么东西，而这里根据上下文得知`none`表示啤酒

   There aren't any students

   There are none

   He's got no money

   He's got none
   ```

3. `get off sth.` 从...下来

   ```
   The boy is getting off the bus

   He got off the bus five minutes ago

   She's just got off the bus
   ```

4. `so` & `neither` 引导的句子

   - 表示肯定：`so + aux./情态动词/be + 主语`

   - 表示否定：`neither + aux./情态动词/be + 主语`

   - 主要看句子中的 `aux.` & `情态动词` & `be`，哪个词是属于这些就把那一个词放到中间。简单来说就是谁能提到句首变一般疑问句，那么就把它放在`so` & `neither` 引导的句子中间

   - 时态一致，人称一致

   ```
   I have a cute cat
   // 这是一般现在时，所以会有一个隐藏的`do`

   So do I
   我也有
   // `do`是上一句话的`aux.`，所以这里也用`do`



   I don't have a cute cat

   Neither do I
   我也没有



   I don't want to work

   Neither does Jack
   杰克也不想
   // 时态注意保持一致

   Neither do I



   I'm very clever

   So am I

   So is he



   I can't sing very good

   Neither can I

   Neither can she



   He got up late yesterday

   So did I
   // 因为上一句是过去式，所以这里也要是过去式

   So did his brother
   ```
