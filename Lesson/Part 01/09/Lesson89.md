Good afternoon. I believe that this house is for sale

That's right

May I have a look at it, please?

Yes, of course. Come in

How long have you lived here?

I've lived here for twenty years

Twenty years! That's a long time

Yes, I've been here since 1976

Then why do you want to sell it?

Because I've just retired. I want to buy a small house in the country

How much does this house cost?

£68500

That's a lot of money!

It's worth every penny of it

Well, I like the house, but I can't decide yet. My wife must see it first
