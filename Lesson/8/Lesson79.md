# Lesson 79

1. `make a shopping list` 写一张购物清单

   ```
   Did you make a shopping list?

   No, I didn't. I'm going to make it
   ```

2. `a lot of` 表示“许多的”。既可用于可数名词又可用于不可数名词，一般用于肯定句中

   ```
   We need a lot of money

   There are a lot of birds in the tree

   He wants a lot of water
   ```

3. `at all` 一般用于否定句，表示“丝毫”、“根本”、“一点”的意思，有强调作用

   ```
   We haven't got any meat at all
   我们丝毫没有一点肉了

   I haven't got any money at all
   我一点钱都没有了

   He hasn't got any water at all
   他根本一点水都没有了
   ```

4. `many` 和 `much` 都表示“许多”。`many` 和 `much` 都用于疑问句和否定句中，但`many`配合可数名词使用，`much`配合不可数名词使用

   ```
   We haven't got many tomatoes

   Have we got many tomatoes?

   He hasn't got much wine

   Has he got much wine?
   ```
