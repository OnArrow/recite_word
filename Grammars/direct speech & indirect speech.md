# Direct Speech & Indirect Speech

## 含义

### Direct Speech

- 直接引语。当事人所说的话

```
杰克说：“我们今天吃什么呢？”
// 引号中的内容就是直接引语

小明对杰克说：“你什么时候离职的？”
```

```
Jack says, 'It's rain, I will take an umbrella'

'You look ill, so you must take some medicine' says the doctor

Jack says to Tom, 'When will you finish your homework?'

'I have arrived in China' says Jack

The girl says, 'I feel tired'
```

### Indirect Speech

- 间接引语。把其他人说的话调整一下人称复述一遍

- 间接引语就是一个宾语从句

```
杰克说他不知道今天吃什么
// “他不知道今天吃什么”是间接引语

小明问杰克他什么时候离职的
// “他什么时候离职的”是一个间接引语
```

```
Jack says it's rain, he will take an umbrella

The doctor says that he looks ill, so he must take some umbrella

Jack says to Tom that when will he finish his homework

Jack says he have arrived in China

The girl says she feels tired
```

## 直接引语改为间接引语时，*时态*也要做相应变化

- 直接引语变为间接引语时，间接引语要后退一个时态

```
5分钟前：
杰克：“我好累”

现在：
汤姆：“杰克说他好累”
// “杰克说他好累”这件事已经是5分钟前发生的了
```

```
Five minutes ago:
Jack says, 'I feel tired'
// 直接引语为一般现在时

Now:
Tom: 'Jack said he felt tired'
// 变为间接引语时，一般现在时改为了一般过去时


Five minutes ago:
Jack says: 'I'm waiting for a bus'
// 直接引语为现在进行时

Now:
Tom: 'Jack said he was waiting for a bus'
// 变为间接引语时，现在进行时改为了过去进行时


Five minutes ago:
Jack says: 'I have finished my homework'
// 直接引语为现在完成时

Now:
Tom: 'Jack said he had finished his homework'
// 变为间接引语时，现在完成时改为了过去完成时


Five minutes ago:
Jack says: 'I broke the vase'
// 直接引语为一般过去时

Now:
Tom: 'Jack said he had broken the vase'
// 变为间接引语时，一般现在时改为了过去完成时


Five minutes ago:
Jack says: 'We are going to go to school this afternoon'
// 直接引语为一般将来时

Now:
Tom: 'Jack said they were going to go to school this afternoon'
// 变为间接引语时，一般将来时改为了过去将来时
```

## 直接引语改为间接引语时，*情态动词*也要做相应变化

- 直接引语变为间接引语时，间接引语中的**情态动词**要变为过去式

```
can -> could

will -> would

shall -> should

may -> might

must -> had to
```

```
Five minutes ago:
Jack says, 'I can swim over the river'

Now:
Tom: 'Jack said he could swim over the river'
// `can`变为`could`


Five minutes ago:
Jack says, 'I will finish the work before 6 p.m.'

Now:
Tom: 'Jack said he would finish the work before 6 p.m.'
// `will`变为`would`


Five minutes ago:
Jack says, 'We may arrive tomorrow'

Now:
Tom: 'Jack said they might arrive tomorrow'
// `may`变为`might`
```

## 直接引语改为间接引语总结

1. 引号去掉
2. 转换人称
3. `that`引导词可加可不加，因为间接引语本身就是一个宾语从句
4. 时态和情态动词都需要跟着变化
