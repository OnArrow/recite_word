# Lesson 87

1. 当用一般疑问句的否定形式来询问时，表示希望得到肯定的回答。可以用“难道”来理解

   ```
   Isn't he lucky?
   他难道不幸运吗？
   // 暗示“他很幸运”

   Didn't you have a crash?

   Isn't that your car?
   ```

2. `drive into` 表示“撞倒”

   ```
   I drove it into a lamp post
   ```

3. `try` 后面一般和 `to + 动词不定式`

   ```
   I'm trying to open the door

   They tried to get it, but failed

   Why don't you try to open it with your hands?
   ```

## A car crash

```
Is my car ready yet?

I don't know, sir. What's the number of your car?

It's LFZ312G

When did you bring it to us?

I brought it here three days ago

Ah, yes, I remember now

Have your mechanics finished yet?

No, they're still working on it. Let's go into the garage and have a look at it

Isn't that your car?

Well, it was my car

Didn't you have a crash?

That's right. I drove it into a lamp-post. Can your mechanics repair it?

Well, they're trying to repair it, sir. But to tell you the truth, you need a new car!
